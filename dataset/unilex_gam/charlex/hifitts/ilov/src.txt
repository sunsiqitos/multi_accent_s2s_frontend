EITHER FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE OR FOR THE SAKE OF THE CUSTOMERS
THE GOOD WOMAN HAD TAKEN INTO HER RETIREMENT AN IDEAL OF GENTLEMANLINESS AS EXHIBITED BY THE PATRONS OF PRIVATE SALOON BARS
LOUDLY EXPLODING SQUIBS AND THE MATTER MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT VERY SERIOUS
AFTER THAT ALTRUISTIC EXPLOIT STEVIE WAS PUT TO HELP WASH THE DISHES IN THE BASEMENT KITCHEN
WHERE THEY PRODUCED A DULL EFFECT OF RUSTINESS
THE WHOLE SOCIAL ORDER FAVOURABLE TO THEIR HYGIENIC IDLENESS HAD TO BE PROTECTED AGAINST THE SHALLOW ENVIOUSNESS OF UNHYGIENIC LABOUR
WITHOUT EITHER RUBBING HIS HANDS WITH SATISFACTION OR WINKING SCEPTICALLY AT HIS THOUGHTS
SWIFT FLOW OF HANSOMS
HIS HAIR HAD BEEN CAREFULLY BRUSHED INTO RESPECTFUL SLEEKNESS
COSMOPOLITAN ENOUGH NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY LONDON'S TOPOGRAPHICAL MYSTERIES
WAS PROCLAIMED BY AN INSCRIPTION PLACED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS BY WHATEVER HIGHLY EFFICIENT AUTHORITY IS CHARGED WITH THE DUTY OF KEEPING TRACK OF LONDON'S STRAYED HOUSES
SAID THE BUREAUCRAT IN AN UNEXPECTEDLY SOFT AND WEARY VOICE
AND BEGAN TO SPEAK IDIOMATIC ENGLISH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF A FOREIGN ACCENT
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED IMBECILES WHO AREN'T FIT TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
PESSIMISTIC GULLIBILITY
AT A LOSS FOR A SUFFICIENTLY IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION
AND AT ANOTHER AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE LOOSEST ASSOCIATION OF DESPERATE BRIGANDS THAT EVER CAMPED IN A MOUNTAIN GORGE
INASMUCH AS YOU CANNOT PLACATE IT EITHER BY THREATS
BEFORE IT REASSEMBLES AGAIN SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED HERE
SHE SPARED PRESENTLY A GLANCE AWAY FROM HER DISHING UP FOR THE INSPECTION OF THAT FACE AND THOSE HANDS WHICH STEVIE
SHE FINISHED HER DISHING UP
BUT MORE LIKE A BEND IN A DUMMY'S LIMB
RESEMBLING IN ITS IMPOTENT FIERCENESS THE EXCITEMENT OF A SENILE SENSUALIST
THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
WHO UNCROSSED HIS THICK LEGS
IN THE SEPULCHRAL SILENCE OF THE GREAT BLIND PILE OF BRICKS NEAR A RIVER
THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY
AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST
THE VENOMOUS SPLUTTERING OF THE OLD TERRORIST WITHOUT TEETH WAS HEARD
I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC
THE OLD TERRORIST
TEMPERAMENTALLY IDENTICAL WITH HIS ASSOCIATES
THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM
TAKINGS VERY SMALL TO DAY
ISSUING FROM THE ARMHOLE OF HIS WAISTCOAT AND PLUNGING INTO THE INNER BREAST POCKET OF HIS JACKET
EFFECTS OF EXPLOSION FELT AS FAR AS ROMNEY ROAD AND PARK PLACE
YOUR DETONATORS
AND AS HER TACTFULNESS PROCEEDED FROM GENUINE HUMANITY
HIS POSITION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO VENTILATE ANY INDEPENDENT VIEW OF A TICKET OF LEAVE CONVICT
HE BEGAN IN A PROCRASTINATING MANNER
INSISTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER UNCANDIDLY
CONSCIOUS OF RENEWED IRRITATION AT THIS DISPLAY OF SCRUPULOUSNESS
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER UNCROSSED HIS LEGS SUDDENLY
WITH A MAN OF THAT SORT SCRUPULOUSNESS WAS A MISPLACED AND EVEN AN ILLEGAL SENTIMENT
IT APPEARED TO HIM JUST AND PROPER THAT THIS AFFAIR SHOULD BE SHUNTED OFF ITS OBSCURE AND INCONVENIENT TRACK
BAREFACED AUDACITY AMOUNTING TO CHILDISHNESS OF A PECULIAR SORT
THE FLOATING AMPLENESS OF HER ANCIENT FORM
AS NOT AFFECTING THE INWARDNESS OF THINGS
THE SCRUNCHED GRAVEL OF THE DRIVE CRYING OUT UNDER THE SLOWLY TURNING WHEELS
PATHETICALLY MENDACIOUS
THE WEATHER WAS TOO BAD AND THE SHOP WAS COSIER THAN THE STREETS
THEY HAD ALSO THE UNWISDOM OF UNNECESSARY THINGS
AND THIS RESEMBLANCE TO A MECHANICAL FIGURE WENT SO FAR THAT HE HAD AN AUTOMATON'S ABSURD AIR OF BEING AWARE OF THE MACHINERY INSIDE OF HIM
WHICH YET HAD A CERTAIN CURTNESS OF INTENTION
APPEARED TO HIM BY A SUDDEN ILLUMINATION AS INVARIABLY WRITTEN BY FOOLS FOR THE READING OF IMBECILES
IT LOOKED AS IF THE GREAT ASSAULT THREATENED FOR THAT NIGHT WERE GOING TO FIZZLE OUT
THAT'S THE BEASTLIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
WHOSE CATASTROPHIC CHARACTER CANNOT BE ARGUED AWAY BY SOPHISTICATED REASONING OR PERSUASIVE ELOQUENCE
WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY INDOCTRINATED WITH THE NECESSITY OF SILENCE IN THE COURSE OF MANY WALKS
THE BOY'S STUTTERING EXISTENCE OF FEARS AND INDIGNATIONS
AND ALL THESE SCENES OF VIOLENCE CAME AND WENT ACCOMPANIED BY THE UNREFINED NOISE OF DEEP VOCIFERATIONS PROCEEDING FROM A MAN WOUNDED IN HIS PATERNAL PRIDE
AFTER A PRELIMINARY GRIMACE WHICH BARED HIS TEETH WOLFISHLY
BECOMES THE MARK FOR DESPERATE AND BLOODTHIRSTY INDIGNATIONS
BY THEIR EXTREME DISACCORD WITH HER MENTAL CONDITION THESE WORDS PRODUCED ON HER A SLIGHTLY SUFFOCATING EFFECT
ITS MENTAL FORM TOOK AN UNREFINED SHAPE CORRESPONDING TO HER ORIGIN AND STATION
BUT AS OFTEN HAPPENS TO PEACEFUL MEN IN DOMESTIC TIFFS
ALL SPOUTING UP TOGETHER IN THE MANNER OF A FIREWORK
AND SHE REMEMBERED IT PICTORIALLY
SHE WAS UNHURRIED
TO THE LAST ITS DECORUM HAD REMAINED UNDISTURBED BY UNSEEMLY SHRIEKS AND OTHER MISPLACED SINCERITIES OF CONDUCT
A LITTLE SWIMMY IN HER HEAD
HER HANDS SHOOK SO THAT SHE FAILED TWICE IN THE TASK OF REFASTENING HER VEIL
THE FRUITERER AT THE CORNER HAD PUT OUT THE BLAZING GLORY OF HIS ORANGES AND LEMONS
WHILE THE COLD LIPS OF A WOMAN MOVED CREEPILY ON HIS VERY EAR TO FORM THE WORDS
THROUGH HER BLACK VEIL THE WHITES OF HER BIG EYES GLEAMED LUSTROUSLY LIKE THE EYES OF A MASKED WOMAN
SOILED WITH INDELIBLE SMUDGES HERE AND THERE
AND SAID DOCTORALLY
AND THE GENERAL TRUCULENCY OF HER ATTITUDE
AND ESPECIALLY TO WARN ALL CITIZENS CAREFUL OF THEIR SAFETY AGAINST INTRUDING ON THE PREMISES WHICH SHE OVERSHADOWS WITH HER WINGS
AS FREQUENT TRANSPLANTATION IS PERHAPS BETTER FOR THE STOCK
UNJOYOUS ATTACHMENT FOR MY NATIVE TOWN THAT BROUGHT ME TO FILL A PLACE IN UNCLE SAM'S BRICK EDIFICE
IT WAS PLEASANT IN THE SUMMER FORENOONS
IN THE FIRST PLACE MY COADJUTORS WERE NOT INVARIABLY OLD
AND IT COULD ONLY BE DIVIDED WITH AN AXE AND HANDSAW
ROUSED BY A TRUMPET'S PEAL
AND WAS JUST AS UNMALLEABLE OR UNMANAGEABLE AS A TON OF IRON ORE
WITH A STENCIL AND BLACK PAINT
NOR VERY READILY DECIPHERABLE ON THEIR MOSSY TOMBSTONES
HAD I REMAINED THERE THROUGH TEN PRESIDENCIES YET TO COME
WITH THE MATERIALITY OF THIS DAILY LIFE PRESSING SO INTRUSIVELY UPON ME
EITHER BY CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE OR EJECTMENT
TO OBSERVE THE BLOODTHIRSTINESS THAT IS DEVELOPED IN THE HOUR OF TRIUMPH
AS REGARDED HIS UNCEREMONIOUS EJECTMENT
HE WAS NEXT TO TREAT WITH HER AS THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD MOST DEEPLY AND IRREPARABLY INJURED
AS A MAN WHO HAS NOT THOUGHT AND PHILOSOPHISED IN VAIN
HERE ON THIS WILD OUTSKIRT OF THE EARTH I SHALL PITCH MY TENT
AMONGST WHOM AND MYSELF THERE EXIST THE CLOSEST LIGAMENTS
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THE DISHONOUR THAT BESMIRCHES THE HUSBAND OF A FAITHLESS WOMAN
WITH STRONGER ASSIMILATIONS THAN THE FIRST
SUCH AS ORDINATIONS
LIKE A GHOST THAT REVISITS THE FAMILIAR FIRESIDE
SAVE BY A FLUSH OF CRIMSON THAT ROSE IRREPRESSIBLY OVER HER PALE CHEEK
BY THE IRREVERENT INOPPORTUNENESS OF THE OCCASIONS THAT BROUGHT IT INTO VIVID ACTION
THAT UNSUNNED SNOW IN THE MATRON'S BOSOM
AND SUCH WAS THE SPLENDOUR OF PEARL'S OWN PROPER BEAUTY
PEARL'S ASPECT WAS IMBUED WITH A SPELL OF INFINITE VARIETY
AND REQUITED IT WITH THE BITTEREST HATRED THAT CAN BE SUPPOSED TO RANKLE IN A CHILDISH BOSOM
THE UNLIKELIEST MATERIALS
WERE THE PUPPETS OF PEARL'S WITCHCRAFT
SO INFINITE WAS THE TORTURE INFLICTED BY THE INTELLIGENT TOUCH OF PEARL'S BABY HAND
DURING WHICH PEARL'S GAZE MIGHT NEVER ONCE BE FIXED UPON THE SCARLET LETTER
ELVISH CAST CAME INTO THE CHILD'S EYES WHILE HESTER WAS LOOKING AT HER OWN IMAGE IN THEM
BUT ANOTHER FACE IN THE SMALL BLACK MIRROR OF PEARL'S EYE
LOOKING SADLY INTO LITTLE PEARL'S WILD EYES
SUCH WAS PEARL'S WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE
WHETHER MOVED ONLY BY HER ORDINARY FREAKISHNESS
WAS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO PEARL'S BEAUTY
BUT OF AN IMP WHO WAS SEEKING TO MOULD ITSELF INTO PEARL'S SHAPE
SUCH AS ELDERLY GENTLEMEN LOVED TO ENDUE THEMSELVES WITH
FOR HE WAS A GRANDFATHERLY SORT OF PERSONAGE
SLOWLY RECOVERING FROM THE ASTONISHMENT INTO WHICH PEARL'S RESPONSE HAD THROWN HIM
GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S BITTER TEMPERED SISTER
IN COLOURS STILL UNFADED
EVEN WHILE THEY VILIFIED AND DECRIED THAT CLASS OF WRITERS
WITH SUCH COMMODIOUSNESS OF SITUATION
THERE WAS AN AGED HANDICRAFTSMAN
WHO HAD BEEN A CITIZEN OF LONDON AT THE PERIOD OF SIR THOMAS OVERBURY'S MURDER
WHO WAS IMPLICATED IN THE AFFAIR OF OVERBURY
FOR RECREATION'S SAKE
IN CONSTRAINING THEM TO PENITENTIAL SELF ABASEMENT
SHE NOW SKIPPED IRREVERENTLY FROM ONE GRAVE TO ANOTHER
WHEN MERELY PROFFERING THE ADVICE WHICH IT WAS HIS DUTY TO BESTOW
HE LOST NO TIME IN MAKING THE AMPLEST APOLOGIES
LACKED HEAVEN'S LAST AND RAREST ATTESTATION OF THEIR OFFICE
ATTIRING HIMSELF WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF IT HAD BEEN FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP
AND WERE BANDYING IT TO AND FRO
THE DROWSY SLUMBERERS MISTOOK THE CRY EITHER FOR SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN A DREAM
AT ONE OF THE CHAMBER WINDOWS OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S MANSION
HE LOOKED LIKE A GHOST EVOKED UNSEASONABLY FROM THE GRAVE
DETECTING THE GLEAM OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S LAMP
THERE WAS WITCHCRAFT IN LITTLE PEARL'S EYES
WORE THAT NAUGHTY SMILE WHICH MADE ITS EXPRESSION FREQUENTLY SO ELVISH
THE ELVISH CHILD THEN LAUGHED ALOUD
HIS MORAL FORCE WAS ABASED INTO MORE THAN CHILDISH WEAKNESS
ABASED BY SIN AND HALF MADDENED BY THE IGNOMINY THAT WAS STILL NEW
YOU BURROW AND RANKLE IN HIS HEART
SHE WONDERED WHAT SORT OF HERBS THEY WERE WHICH THE OLD MAN WAS SO SEDULOUS TO GATHER
IN THE LITTLE CHAOS OF PEARL'S CHARACTER THERE MIGHT BE SEEN EMERGING AND COULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE VERY FIRST
PEARL'S INEVITABLE TENDENCY TO HOVER ABOUT THE ENIGMA OF THE SCARLET LETTER SEEMED AN INNATE QUALITY OF HER BEING
TO JUDGE FROM THE BRIGHT EXPRESSION THAT WAS DANCING ON PEARL'S FEATURES
THERE WAS NO OTHER ATTRIBUTE THAT SO MUCH IMPRESSED HER WITH A SENSE OF NEW AND UNTRANSMITTED VIGOUR IN PEARL'S NATURE
AND BUT THE REFLEX OF THE WILD ENERGY WITH WHICH HESTER HAD FOUGHT AGAINST HER SORROWS BEFORE PEARL'S BIRTH
THE LEAVES MIGHT BESTREW HIM
AND BE KNOWN AS THE VILEST OF ALL SINNERS
BUT WHO KEPT HIS CONSCIENCE ALL ALIVE AND PAINFULLY SENSITIVE BY THE FRETTING OF AN UNHEALED WOUND
THAT THEY SAT AND WATCHED PEARL'S SLOW ADVANCE
AND WERE TO DWELL IMMORTALLY TOGETHER
SEEN IN THE BROOK ONCE MORE WAS THE SHADOWY WRATH OF PEARL'S IMAGE
BUT HOPING THAT A KISS MIGHT PROVE A TALISMAN TO ADMIT HIM INTO THE CHILD'S KINDLIER REGARDS
THE GOOD GRANDAM'S CHIEF EARTHLY COMFORT
BEFORE THIS LAST GOOD LADY HAD BEEN HANGED FOR SIR THOMAS OVERBURY'S MURDER
AND LAID IT RIGHT ACROSS THE MINISTER'S BEDAZZLED EYES
NO JUGGLER WITH HIS TRICKS OF MIMIC WITCHCRAFT
SO OVERFILLING THE CHURCH AS TO BURST ITS WAY THROUGH THE SOLID WALLS
WITH HER MIND HARASSED BY THE TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY IN WHICH THE SHIPMASTER'S INTELLIGENCE INVOLVED HER
WHEREAS THE JEWISH SEERS HAD DENOUNCED JUDGMENTS AND RUIN ON THEIR COUNTRY
WHICH WOULD LOOK ASPIRINGLY UPWARD
LIKE AN UPROOTED WEED THAT LIES WILTING IN THE SUN
LITTLE PEARL AT A MARRIAGEABLE PERIOD OF LIFE MIGHT HAVE MINGLED HER WILD BLOOD WITH THE LINEAGE OF THE DEVOUTEST PURITAN AMONG THEM ALL
IN SO FAR AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOGMATISTS
AND PROBABLY THE TIME IS AT HAND WHEN IT WILL BE ONCE AND AGAIN UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAS ACTUALLY SUFFICED FOR THE BASIS OF SUCH IMPOSING AND ABSOLUTE PHILOSOPHICAL EDIFICES AS THE DOGMATISTS HAVE HITHERTO REARED
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE DOGMATISTS
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL OPPRESSION OF MILLENNIUMS OF CHRISTIANITY FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE
AND CROCHETED TO THESE EVIL AND APPARENTLY OPPOSED THINGS
AS ONE LEARNED ANEW ABOUT HEREDITY AND INNATENESS
IN SPITE OF THEIR REGULATIVE IMPORTANCE FOR US
THAT WHICH CAUSES PHILOSOPHERS TO BE REGARDED HALF DISTRUSTFULLY AND HALF MOCKINGLY
DIVINELY INDIFFERENT DIALECTIC IN CONTRAST TO ALL SORTS OF MYSTICS
FAIRER AND FOOLISHER
THAT WHICH IN THE END ALWAYS PREFERS A HANDFUL OF CERTAINTY TO A WHOLE CARTLOAD OF BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES
BUT THAT IS NIHILISM
THEIR INSTINCT WHICH REPELS THEM FROM MODERN REALITY IS UNREFUTED
THE MYSTICS
AND THE POLITICAL OBSCURANTISTS OF ALL NATIONS
TO FIND AN ANTIDOTE TO THE STILL OVERWHELMING SENSUALISM WHICH OVERFLOWED FROM THE LAST CENTURY INTO THIS
AS REGARDS MATERIALISTIC ATOMISM
AGAINST THE ATOMISTIC REQUIREMENTS WHICH STILL LEAD A DANGEROUS AFTER LIFE IN PLACES WHERE NO ONE SUSPECTS THEM
LET US BEWARE OF SUPERFLUOUS TELEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
IT HAS OCULAR EVIDENCE AND PALPABLENESS OF ITS OWN
IT FOLLOWS INSTINCTIVELY THE CANON OF TRUTH OF ETERNAL POPULAR SENSUALISM
AT LEAST AS REGULATIVE HYPOTHESIS
IF NOT AS HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME LINES THAT THE OLDER ATOMISM SOUGHT
EVEN FROM THE LOGICIAN'S POINT OF VIEW
TO WIT THE INNATE METHODOLOGY AND RELATIONSHIP OF THEIR IDEAS
IF ANY ONE SHOULD FIND OUT IN THIS MANNER THE CRASS STUPIDITY OF THE CELEBRATED CONCEPTION OF FREE WILL AND PUT IT OUT OF HIS HEAD ALTOGETHER
MYTHOLOGICALLY THE NON FREE WILL IS MYTHOLOGY
JUST THE TYRANNICALLY INCONSIDERATE AND RELENTLESS ENFORCEMENT OF THE CLAIMS OF POWER
A PROPER PHYSIO PSYCHOLOGY HAS TO CONTEND WITH UNCONSCIOUS ANTAGONISM IN THE HEART OF THE INVESTIGATOR
IT STUPEFIES
AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MORE LAUDABLE TRUTHFULNESS IN EVERY LITTLE INTERROGATIVE MARK WHICH YOU PLACE AFTER YOUR SPECIAL WORDS AND FAVOURITE DOCTRINES AND OCCASIONALLY AFTER YOURSELVES THAN IN ALL THE SOLEMN PANTOMIME AND TRUMPING GAMES BEFORE ACCUSERS AND LAW COURTS
I MEAN SO CALLED CYNICS
AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE SO MUCH SPIRITUALITY AND TICKLISHNESS AS TO MAKE THEM TALK OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIKE BEFORE WITNESSES
ESPECIALLY AMONG DOCTORS AND MORAL PHYSIOLOGISTS
AND HE WHO PERPETUALLY TEARS AND LACERATES HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN TEETH OR
THE EMANCIPATING SCORN OF A WIND
OUR DEEPEST INSIGHTS MUST
IN OUR YOUTHFUL YEARS WE STILL VENERATE AND DESPISE WITHOUT THE ART OF NUANCE
YOUTH IN ITSELF EVEN IS SOMETHING FALSIFYING AND DECEPTIVE
AND ABOVE ALL ONE ESPOUSES UPON PRINCIPLE THE CAUSE AGAINST YOUTH
THE RETRO OPERATING POWER OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE WAS WHAT INDUCED MEN TO THINK WELL OR ILL OF AN ACTION
AND MEN HAVE JUDGED AND EVEN PHILOSOPHIZED ALMOST UP TO THE PRESENT DAY
AS THE LIVING TOUCHSTONES OF THE SOUL
JUST AS THE AESTHETICS OF DISINTERESTED CONTEMPLATION UNDER WHICH THE EMASCULATION OF ART NOWADAYS SEEKS INSIDIOUSLY ENOUGH TO CREATE ITSELF A GOOD CONSCIENCE
THE ERRONEOUSNESS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE THINK WE LIVE IS THE SUREST AND MOST CERTAIN THING OUR EYES CAN LIGHT UPON
HE IS NOW UNDER OBLIGATION TO DISTRUSTFULNESS
IS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE DEGREES OF SEEMINGNESS
ARE STILL SYNTHETICALLY UNITED WITH ONE ANOTHER
WE MUST MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO POSIT HYPOTHETICALLY THE CAUSALITY OF THE WILL AS THE ONLY CAUSALITY
AND GOOD NATURED DESIRABILITIES SWIM ABOUT PROMISCUOUSLY IN THEIR POND
WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF GERMAN TASTE I WILL NOT OMIT TO UNDERLINE
CLAIM TO BE DESIGNATED AS TEMPTERS
BUT ASSUREDLY THEY WILL NOT BE DOGMATISTS
AT THE OTHER EXTREME OF ALL MODERN IDEOLOGY AND GREGARIOUS DESIRABILITY
APPROPRIATORS
ARRANGERS AND COLLECTORS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
AND EFFECTIVELY FORMULIZE THIS MASS OF DANGEROUS AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCES
WITHOUT NUANCE
WHICH THEN WITH EQUAL SUDDENNESS TRANSFORMS INTO PENITENTIAL PAROXYSMS
MADE ITS LATEST EPIDEMICAL OUTBREAK AND DISPLAY AS THE SALVATION ARMY
THAT WHICH IS SO ASTONISHING IN THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS IS THE IRRESTRAINABLE STREAM OF GRATITUDE WHICH IT POURS FORTH
AND AS IT WERE BEHIND THE QUESTIONABLENESS OF HIS FRAIL AND WRETCHED APPEARANCE
THAT IT VULGARIZES BODY AND SOUL
ENNOBLEMENT OF OBEDIENCE
SOMETHING OF JUSTIFICATION OF ALL THE COMMONPLACENESS
BUT RULE VOLUNTARILY AND PARAMOUNTLY
AND WHEN THEY HAD ALLURED FROM SOCIETY INTO CONVENTS AND SPIRITUAL PENITENTIARIES THE BROKEN HEARTED AND DISTRACTED
TO BREAK DOWN EVERYTHING AUTONOMOUS
COULD APPROACH THIS ALMOST VOLUNTARY DEGENERATION AND STUNTING OF MANKIND
AND PERHAPS ATTEMPTS TO GIVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THE RECURRING AND MORE COMMON FORMS OF THESE LIVING CRYSTALLIZATIONS
OR AN ACCIDENTAL ABRIDGEMENT
HE CAN ACTUALIZE ALL SORTS OF CURVES AND ANGLES
WHEN SHE LOVES HIM JUST AS MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF HIS DEVILRY AND CONCEALED INSATIABILITY
SMALL AND GREAT EXPEDIENCIES AND ELABORATIONS
HE GLORIFIES HIS QUALITIES
THEY HAVE ALSO INHERITED AND INDOCTRINATED INTO THEM A PROPER MASTERY AND SUBTLETY FOR CARRYING ON THE CONFLICT WITH THEMSELVES THAT IS TO SAY
REVENGEFULNESS
CONSEQUENTLY THESE VERY INSTINCTS WILL BE MOST BRANDED AND DEFAMED
THAT WHICH HERE GLORIFIES ITSELF WITH PRAISE AND BLAME
WHO IN THE PRESENT SHALL FIX THE CONSTRAINTS AND FASTEN THE KNOTS WHICH WILL COMPEL MILLENNIUMS TO TAKE NEW PATHS
OR EXPERIENCED HOW AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN HAS MISSED HIS WAY AND DETERIORATED
THE SELF GLORIFICATION AND SELF CONCEITEDNESS OF THE LEARNED MAN IS NOW EVERYWHERE IN FULL BLOOM
TO WHOM ON THE WHOLE OBEDIENCE HAD BEEN FORESWORN
THEIR CONTEMPTIBLENESS
LET IT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO WHAT AN EXTENT OUR MODERN WORLD DIVERGES FROM THE WHOLE STYLE OF THE WORLD OF HERACLITUS
OR WILL ATTACH HIMSELF SOMEWHERE AND SPECIALIZE SO THAT HE WILL NO LONGER ATTAIN TO HIS ELEVATION
AND DETERIORATED
THE CLAIM TO HONOUR AND CONSIDERATION WHICH FIRST AND FOREMOST PRESUPPOSES RECOGNITION AND RECOGNISABILITY
AND HERE ONLY IS HE UNREFINED AND NEGLIGENT PERHAPS HE IS TROUBLED ABOUT THE HEALTH
AND DETERIORATED
ONLY IN HIS SERENE TOTALITY IS HE STILL NATURE AND NATURAL
AN ENGENDERING
THE BEST POWERS OPERATE RESTRICTIVELY
WHICH IS MOST DISEASED AND DEGENERATED IN SUCH NONDESCRIPTS IS THE WILL
HAS KEPT EUROPE FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT AND ITS CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL DISTRUST OWING TO THE INSUPERABLY STRONG AND TOUGH MASCULINE CHARACTER OF THE GREAT GERMAN PHILOLOGISTS AND HISTORICAL CRITICS WHO
THERE MAY BE GOOD GROUNDS FOR IT WHEN WARM BLOODED AND SUPERFICIAL HUMANITARIANS CROSS THEMSELVES BEFORE THIS SPIRIT
HAVE TO FIX AND FORMALIZE SOME GREAT EXISTING BODY OF VALUATIONS
AND ALL SUBJUGATORS OF THE PAST
BUT RATHER AS DISAGREEABLE FOOLS AND DANGEROUS INTERROGATORS
THE CONCEPTION OF GREATNESS PRECISELY IN HIS COMPREHENSIVENESS AND MULTIFARIOUSNESS
OF CREATIVELY FIXING
THAT HOWEVER LITTLE WE MAY IMAGINE OURSELVES TO BE OLD FASHIONED AND GRANDFATHERLY RESPECTABLE IN OTHER RESPECTS
THEY INEVITABLY BECOME OUR INSTINCTIVE CALUMNIATORS AND DETRACTORS
AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER
AND IN GENERAL THE AVERSENESS OF EVERY DISTINGUISHED AND SELF SUFFICING CULTURE TO AVOW A NEW DESIRE
PROPORTIONATENESS IS STRANGE TO US LET US CONFESS IT TO OURSELVES
ARE THE SAME AS THOSE ASSIGNED BY PHYSIOLOGISTS TO EVERYTHING THAT LIVES
AND FALSIFIES FOR ITSELF CERTAIN TRAITS AND LINES IN THE FOREIGN ELEMENTS
ITS OBJECT THEREBY IS THE INCORPORATION OF NEW EXPERIENCES THE ASSORTMENT OF NEW THINGS IN THE OLD ARRANGEMENTS
BUT WE ANCHORITES AND MARMOTS HAVE LONG AGO PERSUADED OURSELVES IN ALL THE SECRECY OF AN ANCHORITE'S CONSCIENCE
QUITE DOWN BELOW THERE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING UNTEACHABLE
UNBRIDLEDNESS
OF ALLEVIATING AND TAKING EASILY
AS CONFINABLE PROPERTY
IN THE SAME WAY AS DISRESPECTFULNESS TO OLD AGE
BUT THE WOMAN WHO UNLEARNS TO FEAR SACRIFICES HER MOST WOMANLY INSTINCTS
THE INCOMPREHENSIBLENESS
AN IMMENSE STUPIDITY MIGHT ONCE AGAIN OVERMASTER THEE AND CARRY THEE AWAY
IT IS AN HONOUR TO GERMANS THAT SUCH A PRIDE DID NOT MISCALCULATE
WHAT FLAVOURS AND FORCES
TO GOOD EUROPEANISM
MISUSE OF WORDS CRIED HIS INTERLOCUTOR CONTRADICTORILY
MAKES THE POWERFULNESS OF THE TYPE IMPOSSIBLE
THE EVENT ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH HE RECONSTRUCTED HIS FAUST AND INDEED THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MAN WAS THE APPEARANCE OF NAPOLEON
HE DIGESTS HIS EVENTS BADLY
FOR QUIET LYRICISM AND INTOXICATION OF THE FEELINGS
THE WHOLE ROMANTICISM AND SUBLIMITY OF MORAL QUESTIONABLENESS
AND EXQUISITE ELEMENT IN THOSE IRIDESCENCES AND ALLUREMENTS TO LIFE
AND WHATEVER ELSE THESE LITTLE OBSCURATIONS OF THE GERMAN SPIRIT AND CONSCIENCE MAY BE CALLED
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ENGLISH MECHANICAL STULTIFICATION OF THE WORLD
A PENITENTIAL FIT MAY REALLY BE THE RELATIVELY HIGHEST MANIFESTATION OF HUMANITY TO WHICH THEY CAN BE ELEVATED
HYPOCHONDRIACS
A BESOTTED AND BRUTALIZED FRANCE AT PRESENT SPRAWLS IN THE FOREGROUND
ONLY IN THEIR SIMULATIONS
DID THEY BELONG TO THE FATHERLANDS
WITH MYSTERIOUS ACCESSES TO ALL THAT SEDUCES
SUCH AS GROWS OUT OF THE INCARNATED DIFFERENCE OF CLASSES
WHICH THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT REFRAIN FROM DOING TO EACH OTHER IT WILL HAVE TO BE THE INCARNATED WILL TO POWER
AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS
WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED THE NOBLE TYPE OF MAN REGARDS HIMSELF AS A DETERMINER OF VALUES
QUARRELSOMENESS
AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES
THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD
A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN
STILL INEXHAUSTED
WHETHER THEY WERE PERHAPS DILIGENT ECONOMIZERS ATTACHED TO A DESK AND A CASH BOX
WHAT AFTER ALL IS IGNOBLENESS
AND DIFFICULTLY COMPREHENSIBLE
AWAY FROM WHAT HIS INSIGHT AND INCISIVENESS
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE HOLY FABLE AND TRAVESTY OF THE LIFE OF JESUS THERE IS HIDDEN ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL CASES OF THE MARTYRDOM OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE
THE STORY OF A POOR SOUL INSATIATED AND INSATIABLE IN LOVE
WET AND SAD AS A PLUMMET WHICH HAS RETURNED TO THE LIGHT INSATIATED OUT OF EVERY DEPTH
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT VERY UNSATISFACTORILY OF MYSELF AND ABOUT MYSELF
ONLY COMPULSORILY
ONE MUST NOT LIVE AMONG INTELLECTUAL IMBECILES
AND FINALLY I WISH PEOPLE TO PUT THE GOOD AMULET
DOES THAT RISE UP IN YOUR LONDONER'S MIND'S EYE
THE LIMITS OF THE CLASSES ARE NOT OF COURSE SO CRUDELY DEFINITE BUT THAT THERE IS AN INFINITY OF INDIVIDUAL VARIANTS
THERE IS ROOM FOR MILLENNIALISTS WHO STRIVE TO CREATE GARDEN CITIES
THE INSCRIPTIONS IN THE KOSHER SHOPS
NAKED MEN RUN PALLIDLY IN AND OUT OF CROWDS OF CARD SHARPERS
SEEING THAT THERE ARE WORKHOUSES
THE WESTPHALIAN WILL SAY
WITH A GLAMOROUS SMIRCHED SUNSET
WELL TO THE EAST OF BROMLEY
THE FACE OF LONDON BIDS FAIR TO CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY
INDEFINABLY
THEY ARE THE SIGNS OF LONDON'S REACHING OUT ITS ARMS STILL FURTHER
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MERE PICTURESQUE SURVIVALS
OR YOU MAY READ IN MISTER ROUND'S COMMUNE OF LONDON HOW GREAT A PART IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY FOREIGN MERCHANTS
IT BEGAN BY LONDON'S SETTLING ON THE BEST PLACED HIGHWAY IN EUROPE
WHICH IN ANY CITY LESS PRODIGAL OF RELICS WOULD BE A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE FOR SIGHTSEERS
THIS PLACE ALWAYS PIQUES MY CURIOSITY
GETTING THE NICKNAME BLANK'S FOLLY GROWING BEGRIMED
THE ROAD WAS UP FOR PUTTING DOWN THE CONDUITS OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM
ANCHORED GROUPS OF SKIFFS WHERE SAND IS HAULED LABORIOUSLY IN BUCKETS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER
DIGESTED THEM INTO SUMMARIES AND FINALLY READ THEM OUT TO BOARDS OF DIRECTORS
HIS DENSE LONDON IS THE CITY AS FAR AS FENCHURCH STREET
OR WHETHER YOU DREAM THAT BEFORE RETIRING YOU WILL GET YOURSELF TURNED INTO A LIMITED COMPANY WITH A CAPITAL OF SIX CYPHERS AT THE TAIL OF A NUMERAL YOU GO THERE TO GET SOMETHING TO DO
OF THE RUDDIEST
OF THE BLONDEST
HENCE THE IMMENSITY OF LONDON'S SILENT APPEAL
RODERICK RANDOM'S IDEA OF MAKING A CAREER AFTER THE WARS HAD FAILED HIM
SANGUINELY AND AMIABLY EXPLAINED
FINANCED THIS PARTNER HAD TAKEN CARE TO BE EARLY IN THE MARKET
HIS PARTNER MIGHT SCOOP THE MARKET WITH BOSNIANS WHEN THE HONDURAS CROP FAILED
WHICH ALONG WITH NAPOLEONS OF SPECIALITIES
ONE MAN AS A RULE RENDERS TRUE LITTLE COGWHEELS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MACHINE
THERE IS NO CALL AT ALL MADE UPON THE SPECIAL CRAFTSMAN'S INTELLECT THAT IS IN ALL THE HUMAN RACE
SHE WOULD UTTER LONG BURSTS OF LANGUAGE THAT WAS A MIXTURE OF MEANINGLESS OBSCENITIES AND OF AN OLD FASHIONED AND FORMAL ENGLISH
AFTER A YEAR OR TWO OF MATCHBOX MAKING THE FACTS OF THEIR INSTRUCTION ARE WORN DOWN OUT OF THEIR MINDS AND THAT VERY VIRTUE OF THEIR MOTHERS
AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF HIS TIME HE SET UP FOR HIMSELF AS A JOBBING CABINET MAKER
HE HAD IN HIM AN ASTONISHING FACULTY FOR KNOWING WHAT THE PUBLIC IN THIS CASE MOSTLY YOUNG MARRYING COUPLES COULD BE INDUCED TO WANT HE TURNED OUT CHEAP CHIPPENDALES
THE HOT WATER FROM THE BOILERS OF THE CEMENT WORKS RUNS IN THOSE OPEN CONDUITS TO SEPARATE IN THE SAND WORKS THE SAND FROM THE LOAM
OR IF YOU HAD BEEN A SATURDAY FOOTBALLER WHO MISSED ONE MATCH
AT BRIGHT RED AND FLAME PLUMAGED POULTRY ON THE GREEN BELOW HIM
AT NIGHTFALLS HE WOULD GO TO HIS PUBLIC HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF PINTS OF ALE AND A FEW PIPES
MERE BANK HOLIDAY CAROUSES
THEIR OWNER SAYS RHAPSODICALLY
DOWN THERE IT MEANT FORTY SHILLINGS IF THE KEEPER CAUGHT YOU SO MUCH AS SMELLING A PHEASANT'S NECK FEATHER
PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE TO THE LOWER ORDER OF LONDONER KAISER'S TELEGRAMS IS AN EVIDENCE OF IT
WHY IN FACT A CONVERSATIONAL ARTIST STRIKES US NOWADAYS AS A BOUNDER
BUT IF HIS DINNER TABLE HAS BECOME DEMOCRATIZED
THE TOWN STILL HAS ITS AIR OF BEING A VAST CEMETERY OF LARGE MAUSOLEUMS
ALL THAT UNENDING PROCESSION THAT ON WEEK DAYS RATTLES AND REVERBERATES THROUGHOUT THE MORNING
IN THE BACKYARDS OF SMALL COTTAGES
BOTH GIRL AND YOUNG MAN UTTERING OBSCENITIES POSITIVELY ASTOUNDING
IF WE TAKE SO MUCH INTEREST IN OUR TOWN AS TO BE MODERATES OR THE REVERSE WE MAY DISLIKE OUR OPPONENTS
WHERE IS LONDON'S DISTINGUISHED FELLOW CITIZEN THESE THINGS ARE HERE UNKNOWN
A MORE OR LESS STRONG FLAVOUR OF THE THEORIST WHO SEES MANKIND ONLY IN THE BULK
AND PERSONAL INFRINGEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL CODES
WHO STANDS MIDWAY BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALIST AND THE THEORIST
A BROAD SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT REDDENS FOR AN INSTANT
TO DISSOCIATE IN OUR MINDS THE IDEA OF LONDON FROM THE IDEA OF A VAST CLOUD BENEATH A CLOUD AS VAST
SPRINGS AND MARSHLAND
IT IS ONLY THE AUDIENCE THAT IS UNREACHABLE
OR DEMARCATIONS
PORTABILITY IN OUR HOUSES
BECAUSE GROUND THAT HAS BEEN DWELT UPON TOO LONG LOSES ITS RESILIENCE
THE PRAISER OF TIMES PAST WILL TELL US THAT THE BREED IS DETERIORATING PHYSICALLY
BUT THE CONTEMPLATIVE PORTION OF OUR PSYCHOLOGIES SEEMS TO REPLY TO THESE EXTREMISTS THAT THERE IS NEVER ANY CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF MAN
IN SPITE OF THE EFFORT OF THE ARCHITECT OR JOBBING BUILDER TO RENDER EACH OF THOSE HOUSE BOXES INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE OTHER
TO STICK UP LITTLE BOXES FOR THE STARLINGS TO NEST IN
OR IN BOWLERS
NO DOUBT THEY WILL FIND AMONG THEMSELVES WOMEN TO WIVE WITH
THAT THE ADDRESS ON THE FORSAKEN BROOMSTICK'S COLLAR WAS
SHE WAS THE MANAGERESS OF THE ONLY SHOP ON MITTEN ISLAND
FOR THAT WAS THE BROOMSTICK'S NAME
BUT ITS MANAGERESS HAD HARDLY GOT HER HEAD WELL INTO THE BASIN WHEN SOMEBODY ENTERED
AND PROTOPLASMS
SAYING PEDANTICALLY
ASPIDISTRAS
HEAVEN PROBABLY MEANT TO MAKE A NOBLE WOMAN OF ME BY ENCRUSTING ME IN DISABILITIES
LECTURES ON HYPNOTISM OR SPIRITUALISM
CATERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE AVERAGES
BUT SHE WAS NOT A SKILLED WINKER
UTTERLY RESOURCELESS PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES REDUCED TO READING THE PENNY STAMPS ON YESTERDAY'S LETTERS
THUS THRIFTILY MAKING ROOM FOR THE SINS OF THE COMING DAY
THERE AIN'T NEVER A PENNY PUT IN THE SLOT FOR THE MOONLIGHT
THERE ARE PEOPLE TO WHOM A REAM OF VIRGIN PAPER IS AN INSPIRATION
A SHORT ONE FOR REGISTRARS AND WORKERS
HIGH ON THE LIST OF CRIMES POSSIBLE TO REGISTRARS AND WORKERS IS SENTIMENTALITY
COLLECTING KUDOS UNDER ASSUMED NAMES
IN THE INTEREST OF THE SUPERFLUOUSLY COMFORTABLE
WHEN THE CONDUCTOR OF ONE COMPARTMENT FELL SUDDENLY IN LOVE WITH THE CONDUCTRESS OF THE NEXT
OF STOKE NEWINGTON
WITH REAL BOOTLACES
THIS MANIA SPREAD UNTIL EVEN THE OUTLYING BASSOONS
FROM A CLARINET CAUSED A DEVASTATING DUMBNESS TO FALL SUDDENLY ON EVERY INSTRUMENT EXCEPT THE PIANO
THAT'S COUNTING A BOX OF OXO CUBES I HAVE BY ME
WHO WITH A RATHER TIRESOME PERSISTENCE WAS NOW LEVITATING THE CHICKEN
JUST AS THEY REACHED THE DOOR OF THE CRYPT
THE VICAR ALLOWS NO ANIMALS INSIDE THE CRYPT
THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE CRYPT THEREFORE
SO OBVIOUSLY UNTENDER WERE HER YEARS
PINEHURST'S ONE HOBBY WAS HIS WINDOWS
THE VILLAINS SHE SAID KITTENISHLY
THE VICAR'S DOG STILL HOWLING RAN INTO THE CRYPT
EVERYBODY SAW AT ONE PITIFUL GLANCE THAT THESE WERE UNFORTUNATE HOUSEHOLDERS
AND ONE OF THE OLD LADIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CRYPT SUDDENLY THREW DOWN HER KNITTING AND BEGAN CONFESSING HER SINS
THE OLD KNITTER HAD BEEN RATHER ANNOYED TO FIND HER CONFESSION INTERRUPTED
AND THE TALK IN THE CRYPT SEEMED TO LOSE ITS MEANING
THE PALE PARTY FILED OUT OF THE CRYPT AND DISAPPEARED
UNBLOTTED BY PEOPLE
SHE HEARD QUITE DISTINCTLY THE APPROACH OF LONDON'S GUESTS
OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO SQUIRT UNPLEASANT ENCHANTMENTS DOWNWARD
BISCUIT TINS BUTTRESSED THE COUNTER ON EVERY SIDE
DUST PANS DIVORCED FROM THEIR BRUSHES WERE PLATONICALLY ATTACHED TO FLAT IRONS OR PIE DISHES
HIS PRESENCE WAS A CONSTANT PLAYTIME FOR HER MIND
CLOCKS AND CALENDARS HAVE NO MEANING IN THE FOREST
GRASSHOPPERS TATTED INDUSTRIOUSLY AND IMPARTIALLY AMONG THE DAISIES AND THE VIOLETS
DAVID RETORTED TO THIS DOG'S FIRST FACETIOUS ONSLAUGHT WITH A KINDLY QUIP
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME WHEN MY BACK'S TURNED
THE RED LIGHT FROM THE HORSE VIVIAN'S NECK MADE A SORT OF HERALDING GHOST BEFORE THEM ON THE GRASS
BUT SURELY A CHAPEL GOER
SEEM TO BE OUTSTAYING YOUR WELCOME
EVERY BUTTON ON HIS UNIFORM AND EVERY BUCKLE ON THE HORSE VIVIAN'S HARNESS CAUGHT THE MOONLIGHT
PROBABLY NOT EVEN THE PENULTIMATE ONE
WHO HAD A HEROIC AND ALMOST CINEMATIC GIFT FOR BEING ON HAND AT THE RIGHT MOMENTS
I DO NOT THINK THAT WE HOT BLOODED CREOLES SORROW LESS FOR SHOWING IT SO IMPETUOUSLY
AND RESTOCKED IT
FOR I HAD GAINED A REPUTATION AS A SKILFUL NURSE AND DOCTRESS
IF NOT AS INEXPENSIVELY
ALL I COULD GET TO EAT WAS SOME GUAVAS
AND THE SLAPJACK
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MY PATIENTS HAD NOTHING BETTER TO GIVE THEIR DOCTRESS THAN THANKS
AND EVERY EFFORT MADE TO VENTILATE THE PLACE
AND I AM SURE I COULD NOT WIELD THE SCALPEL OR THE SUBSTITUTE I THEN USED NOW
WITH WATTLED SIDES
BUT THE YANKEE'S CAPACITY FOR SWILLING TEA AND COFFEE WAS PRODIGIOUS
WITH SHIRT COLLAR TURNED DOWN OVER A VELVET LAPELLED COAT
AND STABBED BY THESE FREE AND INDEPENDENT FILIBUSTERS
AND VERY OFTEN MARCHED UNSHOD
AND I GUESS IF WE COULD BLEACH HER BY ANY MEANS WE WOULD
AND PLENTY OF MATERIAL WAS PROCURABLE FROM THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER
THEIR CRIES RINGING IN OUR EARS ABOVE THE STORM'S PITILESS FURY
BUT ALTHOUGH THE FLESH OF THE IGUANA
THESE IGUANAS ARE IMMENSE GREEN LIZARDS
THE SPANISH INDIANS HAVE A PROVERB REFERRING TO AN IGUANA SO BOUND
FOR HUMANITY AND CIVILIZATION'S SAKE
AND ACCORDINGLY I ATTACHED MYSELF TO THEIR QUARTERS WITH THE SAME UNWEARYING ARDOUR
THAT SHE HAS TAKEN HER PASSAGE IN THE SCREW STEAMER HOLLANDER TO START FROM LONDON ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JANUARY
I HAD SCARCELY SET MY FOOT ON BOARD THE HOLLANDER BEFORE I MET A FRIEND
AND TURNED MY GAZE HOPEFULLY TO THE AS YET LANDLESS HORIZON
I NEVER FAILED TO TAKE AN ALMOST CHILDISH INTEREST IN THE SIGNALS WHICH PASSED BETWEEN THE HOLLANDER AND THE FLEET OF VESSELS WHOSE SAILS WHITENED THE TRACK TO AND FROM THE CRIMEA
AND RETURNING TO THE HOLLANDER AT NIGHTFALL
NOT LEAST IN THE PATIENT UNMURMURING RESIGNATION WITH WHICH THEY SUFFER
AND THE IMPROBABILITY OF MY FINDING THE HOLLANDER IN THE DARK
BUT AT LAST A BED WAS DISCOVERED TO BE UNOCCUPIED AT THE HOSPITAL WASHERWOMEN'S QUARTERS
AND START FOR THE HOLLANDER
I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TRANSPORTED MY THINGS FROM THE HOLLANDER TO THE ALBATROSS
THE ALBATROSS'S SIDE WAS REACHED
BEHIND THE ENGINEERS' QUARTERS
BUT THOSE WHO HAD PORK EXPECTANCIES
THAT THE OFFICERS WERE GLAD OF ME AS A DOCTRESS AND NURSE MAY BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD
WHO WOULD ALMOST PREFER EATING HIS MEAT RAW TO HAVING THE TROUBLE OF COOKING IT OUR ENGLISH SOLDIERS ARE BAD CAMPAIGNERS
WHO WERE GLAD OF ME AS NURSE AND DOCTRESS
SENT FOR THE DOCTRESS WHOM HE HAD KNOWN IN KINGSTON
BUT I HAVE THREE EXCUSES TO OFFER FOR MY UNHISTORICAL INEXACTNESS
THESE WERE THE FIRST REGIMENT OF SARDINIAN GRENADIERS
WE ALL ADMIRED AND LIKED THE SARDINIANS
IN CHARGE OF MY STEADIEST LAD
SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE RESERVES OF SIR HENRY BARNARD'S DIVISION
THERE WAS GREAT DISTRESS IN THE SARDINIAN CAMP ON THIS ACCOUNT
AND FORMED A PICTURE SO EXCITINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT WE FORGOT THE SUFFERING AND DEATH THEY LEFT BEHIND
I ATTENDED TO THE WOUNDS OF MANY FRENCH AND SARDINIANS
THE WOUNDED OF THE LADDER AND SANDBAG PARTIES CAME UP EVEN WITH A LAUGH
AND MAKING MY WAY TO GENERAL GARRETT'S QUARTERS
THERE IS A LOOK OF DIVINE CALMNESS AND HEAVENLY LOVE IN THE MADONNA'S FACE WHICH IS VERY STRIKING
IS ENOUGH TO UNNERVE THE STRONGEST AND SICKEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED
USUALLY LED TO RECRIMINATORY STATEMENTS
WATERLOO WAS BONO
WATERLOO WAS BONO
IRREVERENTLY TEARING OPEN HER MOTHER'S TELEGRAM AND READING IT AS SHE CAME
AUNT CRETE'S EYES SHONE
AUNT CRETE'S HEART BEAT WITH ANTICIPATION AS HE HANDED HER A LITTLE WHITE BOX
SAID THE EAGER PLANNER
AND SHE SMILED AGAIN AT AUNT CRETE'S KINDLY BEAMING FACE
AUNT CRETE'S HAND TREMBLED AS SHE TOOK THE FIRST SPOONFUL
AND WAS A REHASH OF THE TELEPHONE MESSAGE
HE HAD FELT THAT THE FRENCH MAID WOULD KNOW HOW TO PUT JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH TO AUNT CRETE'S PRETTY HAIR TO TAKE AWAY HER ODD
AUNT CRETE'S BACK WAS HAPPILY TOWARD HER RELATIVES
IT MADE THE PINK COME AND GO AGAIN IN AUNT CRETE'S CHEEKS
AND AUNT CRETE'S WISTFUL LOOK MADE DONALD ASK WHETHER SHE FELT TOO TIRED TO TAKE ANOTHER DIP
SHE FELT LIKE QUITE AN EXPERIENCED BATHER
I'LL TELL HER THE SWELLING'S GONE DOWN
AND THE SLINKY SAG OF HER OLD GOWNS
THEN DONALD CAME TO THE FRONT FOR HE FEARED FOR AUNT CRETE'S POISE
SHE TOSSED HER HEAD WITH A KITTENISH MOVEMENT
AND THEN HE TOOK AUNT CRETE'S HANDS LOVINGLY
HOW DID YOU COME TO SPRAIN IT SO BADLY
WITH HER EYES TURNED TRUSTINGLY TOWARD HER DEAR DONALD
AS IF HE HAD NOT SEEN HER IMPATIENT HAND CLAIMING HER RIGHT TO READ AUNT CRETE'S NOTES
THOUGH WHEN HE LOOKED UPON AUNT CRETE'S HAPPY FACE
IT WAS ALL AUNT CRETE'S FAULT
BUT AUNT CRETE'S QUAVERING VOICE STOPPED SUDDENLY IN MILD AFFRIGHT
AUNT CRETE PUT HER LITTLE CURLED WHITE HEAD IN ITS CRISPING PINS DOWN ON DONALD'S COAT SLEEVE
YOU KNEW HIS BROTHER PANDA AND HIS CAPTAINS
AND I KNOW THAT THE ZULUS WERE QUITE IMPRESSED THAT SOME CALAMITY WAS ABOUT TO BEFALL THEM
AND IGNITED THE GRASS OVER THE GRAVES OF THE FORMER KINGS OF ZULULAND
FAR AWAY IN ZULULAND THERE IS A CLEFT UPON THE GHOST MOUNTAIN
THE KING WHO DIED FOR NADA
LIKE A PLAIN OF SEEDING GRASS THEY BENT
SAYING IT WAS WELL THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD KNOW THE SICKNESSES OF WOMEN AND LEARN HOW TO CURE THEIR EVIL TEMPERS
ARE THERE THEN NO OTHER NEW BORN BABES IN ZULULAND
WHISPERER IN THE KING'S EAR
MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND THIS WAS MY PLAN TO FLY FAR FROM ZULULAND
SHE WHO LIVED TO BE NADA THE BEAUTIFUL
AND I ONLY SPEAK OF THEM BECAUSE THE BEAUTY OF NADA WAS RATHER AS IS THE BEAUTY OF THE WHITE PEOPLE THAN OF OURS
AND WHERE HE WENT THERE NADA FOLLOWED
PRESENTLY SHE SAW NADA SEATED UPON THE GRASS WEAVING FLOWERS
NOW AS SHE CAME SO THE CHILD TOLD ME SUDDENLY A COLD WIND SEEMED TO BREATHE UPON NADA
ALREADY SHE HAD GRASPED NADA BY THE HAIR
AND THERE SHALL BE SUCH A SMELLING OUT OF WIZARDS AND OF WITCHES AS HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN IN ZULULAND
AND AS THEY NODDED THE NECKLETS OF BONES RATTLED ON THEIR SKINNY NECKS
THE MOTHER OF NADA
NADA WAS SO WEAK FROM GRIEF THAT SHE COULD HARDLY TRAVEL
AND I DREW NADA ASIDE AND SPOKE TO HER THUS
BUT AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED MY DAUGHTER NADA
AND THE GIRL WHO IS NAMED NADA
SUCH A MOURNING AS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN IN ZULULAND
AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW THE FACE OF NADA AS SHE RAN FROM THE FENCE OF THORNS
FOR OF ALL LADS AMONG THE ZULUS HE WAS THE SWIFTEST OF FOOT
THERE IS NO MAN AMONG THEM SINCE THE ZULUS KILLED MY HUSBAND
TARRYING NOT
WHILE HIS GREAT JAWS CLOSED WITH A CLASH BUT A SPEAR'S BREADTH BENEATH THE DEAD MAN'S FOOT
AND LIFTING THE WATCHER ENDWAYS
ON A NIGHT HE DREAMED OF NADA
AND AS HE BENT TAPPED WITH THE POINT OF THE AXE AT THE HEAD OF THE SMITER
YET HUNGER AND THIRST SHALL FINISH THE SPEAR'S WORK
THE GREATEST MAN WHO HAS EVER LIVED IN ZULULAND
NOW PANDA WAS A MAN OF GENTLE HEART
BECAUSE I LOVED PANDA
SO PANDA WAS MADE GOVERNOR OF THE KING'S CATTLE
FOR IT WAS THE GRIP OF PANDA'S TEETH THAT PULLED HIM FROM THE THRONE
MOVED BACK TO ZULULAND
AND AS YET UNWED
THE MAID WHO WAS NAMED THE LILY WAS NO OTHER THAN MY DAUGHTER NADA
THAT NONE BUT NADA COULD BE SO FAIR
WAS THE BEAUTY OF NADA AND NOTHING ELSE
AND OF NADA WHAT OF NADA MY SISTER
AND TELL HIM THAT NADA WAS NO SISTER OF HIS
MY SISTER NADA
HE STEADIES HIS PACE HE GATHERS HIMSELF TOGETHER AND NOW HE LEAPS
THIS ONE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ZULULAND
AND WHY WOULD YOU NOT WED NADA MY SISTER
AND HOW SHALL THIS BE NADA
AND WHERE WILL YOU WANDER NADA
NOW NADA TREMBLED AT HIS WORDS OF EVIL OMEN
AND THAT HE SHOOK THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS HE HELD IT OVER HER HE WHOSE HAND WAS OF THE STEADIEST
THE LILY WAS NONE OTHER THAN NADA
BECAUSE OF NADA
YET I WAS WELL PLEASED WITH MY FATHERING OLD MAN
NADA THE LILY IS NO SISTER TO ME
NADA IS NOT YET AT YOUR GATES AND PERHAPS SHE WILL NEVER FIND THEM
BUT AT LENGTH NADA CAME
WE SHALL NEVER LOOK MORE ON NADA
IT WAS THE FACE OF NADA
NOW MY HEART WENT OUT TO NADA AS SHE STOOD IN THE MOONLIGHT
SAID NADA
NOW WHEN NADA SAW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED HER SHE THREW DOWN THE SHIELD AFTER THE SPEAR
AY I CALLED BUT WHERE IS THE OLD MAN WHO TREATED ME SO SCURVILY
AND SHE WAS CALLED NADA OH
AY NADA AND I KNEW YOU FROM THE FIRST
THAT NADA WAS CAPTURED BY ROBBERS
THEY DID THIS BECAUSE OF THAT MEDICINE OF THE EYES WHICH NADA HAD ONLY AMONG WOMEN
AND WHILE THEY KILLED EACH OTHER FOR IT CAME ABOUT THAT NADA BROUGHT DEATH UPON THE ROBBERS AS ON ALL OTHERS SHE ESCAPED
HE IS YOUR COUSIN NADA
ANSWERED NADA SMILING
I WILL BEAR THE RISK NADA
NOW I TOOK NADA BY THE HAND AND LED HER THROUGH THE MORNING AIR TO THE PLACE OF ASSEMBLY
NOW WHAT THERE WAS IN THE GLANCE OF NADA I CANNOT SAY
FOR THE GLAMOUR OF NADA WAS UPON THEM AND THEY WOULD CHERISH HER AS OTHERS HAD CHERISHED HER
SHE HAD KNOWN THAT NADA WAS NO SISTER TO HIM
NOR WAS THE MOTHER OF NADA MY MOTHER
LEST HE SHOULD BRING DOWN THE WRATH OF PANDA UPON HIM
AND NADA HELD OUT HER HANDS TOWARDS HER
THEY LOOKED UP AND SAW NADA PASS THEN WORKED ON SULLENLY
NADA IS BUT A WOMAN
NOW NADA SAW WHAT WAS MEANT AND THE BLOOD POURED TO HER HEAD
NAY NADA THERE IS STILL SOMETHING TO SAY
ALL THE WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN SHALL COME TO IT EXCEPT NADA
I ONLY KNOW THAT WE ARE MINDED TO BE RID OF NADA
AND ON THOSE MEN WHO FOLLOW AFTER THE BEAUTY OF NADA
ONLY HE TOLD HER THAT NADA SHOULD NOT GO TO THE FEAST
AND HE POINTED TO NADA
FOR HE WOULD BE GOING AFTER NADA
THE BLOOD OF NADA THE LILY
WHO IS KNOWN AS NADA THE LILY
BECAUSE OF THE COMING OF NADA
YET BECAUSE OF NADA IT SEEMS THAT I MUST
SAID NADA
BUT AGAIN HE LOOKED AT NADA AND SPED ON
THEN WE MUST STAND FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE KNEES OF THE WITCH IN FRONT OF THE CAVE WHERE NADA IS
THE PACK WAS HALVED
AND THIS IS THE HOME OF THEIR SORCERIES
AND THE SLAUGHTERER'S GUARD IS DOWN
AND NEVER PECKS IN VAIN
AND DROVE HIM BACK A SPEAR'S LENGTH
ALL DAY LONG NADA CROUCHED IN THE CAVE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS OF WAR THAT CREPT FAINTLY UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
AFTERWARDS MADNESS FELL UPON NADA
IT IS I NADA
SAID NADA
NOW IT WAS AT THE HOUR OF DAWN THAT NADA DIED
AND BY IT WE SAW THE SHAPE OF NADA MY DAUGHTER
I BURIED NADA MY DAUGHTER
I WARNED PANDA THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO TO THIS HUNT
BUT PANDA WAS FAITHFUL AND GOOD
THEN THE WHITE CAPTAIN AND PANDA SMILED AND SAID
THERE LIVED A CERTAIN WOMAN AND SHE WAS NAMED NADA THE LILY
THAT HOUR WHEN NADA HAD DIED
ONE OF THOSE SINGULARLY GOOD HEARTED MEN WHO RESCUE HUMANITY FROM THE CYNICS
THE VILEST PASSIONS UNCHAINED
I WAS NOT A LITTLE ATTACHED TO THE THEORIST
TO MORROW A CORRUPT OFFICIALISM AND THE SAME SLAVISH MULTITUDE
WITH SOME READY MADE CONSTITUTION AND BRAND NEW PANACEAS FOR SUFFERING
HITHERTO HE HAD BEEN A MERE THEORIST WITH A VERY KINDLY SIDE
AND IT APPEARED NOW THAT THE INGATHERING OF THE HARVEST WAS NIGH
A CURIOUS CONTRAST TO THE INKINESS OF THE CLOUDY PALL ABOVE US
HORRIFIED WITH MY THOUGHTS FOR THE POTENTIALITIES OF THIS FELL VESSEL DAZED ME I CLUNG FIERCELY TO BURNETT'S ARM
WHAT A CONTRAST IT MUST HAVE AWAKENED BETWEEN HIS PRESENT POWER AND THE ABJECTNESS OF THE FUGITIVE OF TEN YEARS BACK
YOU DO NOT PROPOSE THEN TO LEAVE ANARCHY UNSEASONED
OF THE MOONLIGHT FLOODING OUR DECKS AS WE SPED OVER THE STREAKY MISTS BELOW
THE RARITY OF THE AIR IS UNSATISFYING
TWO FUNNELLED BATTLE SHIP WITH A TRAIL OF BLACK SMOKE FAINTLY DECIPHERABLE IN HER WAKE
AND FEELING FOR THE RUNGS WAS A PURGATORY
AND GLIDING OILILY AND WITHOUT SHOCK TO THE GROUND
I TOOK IT FROM HER HAND REVERENTIALLY
THEY HAD NOT BEEN SHOT AGAINST THE WALL BY THE FURIOUS RESTORERS OF ORDER
JUST THEN A SQUAD OF SOLDIERS PASSED BY ESCORTING SOME INCENDIARIES
AND FOR SECURITY'S SAKE THEY HAD UNROLLED THIS AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GRASS
BUT SO COMPOSITELY APPALLING IN ITS DETAILS AS TO BAFFLE THE DEFTEST PEN
MISTER TOMPKINS HERE SETS BEFORE YOU SOME TWO OR MORE SCORES OF INTERESTING TRIPS WELL WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERYBODY
MOUNTS WILSON AND IRVINE
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC IS IN PART
THE HEALTH VALUE OF WALKING THIS IS MANIFEST FROM THE FOLLOWING EXCERPTS
IT IS ADJUSTABLE
KNAPSACKS OF THE KIND DESCRIBED ARE NEITHER PROCURABLE IN SYDNEY NOR IN AUSTRALIA
AS IN THE CASE OF THE RUCKSACK
OR FRANKFURT SAUSAGE
THE USE OF A VERY HEAVY BOOT MEANS NEEDLESS OVERWEIGHTING
LIKE DOSSING IN WET SANDSTONE CAVES AND ABANDONED HUTS WITH UNSAVOURY COMPANIONS OF THE ROAD
BROCHURES AND MAPS GIVING DETAILED PARTICULARS OF MOST OF THE STATE'S TOURIST DISTRICTS MAY BE HAD GRATIS FROM THE BUREAU
ONE IS UNSUITABLY CLAD
AND THERE IS A TRAIN AT SEVEN A M FROM REDFERN
SO MIGHT IN HIS UNDEVELOPED FORCE WITH ALL HIS CROWDING UNACCOMPLISHED HOPES
FROM THE RIVER TO HEATHCOTE IS A WELL FORMED BUT QUITE UNUSED ROAD OF SOMEWHAT STEEP GRADE
TAKE TRAIN EITHER AT LOFTUS JUNCTION OR NATIONAL PARK
AND THE SANDSTONES HAVE BEEN ALTERED INTO THE MOST PERFECT EXAMPLES OF QUARTZITE THAT ARE KNOWN ABOUT SYDNEY
IN THE PIOUS BUT INSANITARY FASHION OF A CENTURY AGO
KELLY'S WATERFALL
FROM THE TOP OF WHICH ONE OF THE FINEST PANORAMAS OF LANDSCAPE AND SEASCAPE OPENS OUT
AND REACHES WISEMAN'S FERRY ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK
THERE IS AMPLE TIME DURING THE AFTERNOON TO CROSS THE FERRY AND ENJOY THE LOVELY VIEW OF THE MACDONALD RIVER VALLEY
AND QUITE UNSUITABLE FOR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC
WHICH ARE GIVEN OVER TO THE CHARGE OF CARETAKERS FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE YEAR
BUT IS OCCUPIED MOSTLY BY SELECTORS
THE INTERVAL BEFORE BREAKFAST CAN BE ENJOYABLY FILLED IN WITH A PAIR OF FIELD GLASSES
EVEN IF YOU HAVE VISITED FITZROY PREVIOUSLY
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO SPEND ANY TIME AT FITZROY LEAVE SYDNEY FOR MOSS VALE BY THE EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY MORNING
CROSS THE RIVER JUST AFTER PASSING MISTER TATE'S HOMESTEAD
LUNCH AT NELLIE'S GLEN
AND THE ACCOMMODATION DISPENSED BY MISTER CARETAKER CHALKER WILL SORELY TEMPT YOU TO WITHDRAW
PORTABILITY IS ITS DOMINANT NOTE
AND IT TRANSPIRES THAT SWAGGY IN HIS DAY HAD BEEN A CONSIDERABLE ACROBAT
HARKING BACK TO THE OLD GAME
HAD THEY ANY CRICKETERS OR FOOTBALLERS IN THE VALLEY
FOR THE TIME THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND NOT UNTUNEFUL BUSH ORCHESTRA
WE FIND MISTER CHALKER AWAY FROM HOME
MISTER CHALKER WAS MOST ATTENTIVE TO OUR WANTS
AND THE VENTURE PETERED OUT AFTER FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF STRUGGLE
HENCE WE CAN AFFORD TO LOITER AND LUXURIATE
AS WE REST AFTER LUNCH SOME OF THE LOCALS COME DOWN TO BATHE
THE HOLDINGS ARE APPARENTLY OF SMALL ACREAGE
BUT THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE FARMERS AND THE STATISTICIAN TO SETTLE
BUT WE DEEMED IT TO BE NONE OTHER THAN SOME BARK OF THE FISH BITERS
AND TOOK HIS NEW SHAFTED SPEAR IN HAND AND SHOOK THE REIN
AND THE WIND DIED OUT INTO THE AIMLESS GUSTINESS OF HOLLOW PLACES
AS A HEN CACKLES A LONG WHILE
DOST THOU NOT SEE HOW THE SUN SHINETH ON IT
THOU LIFTER OF THE SPOIL
AND AS FOR THY FRIEND THE SPEARMAN
SHE HAD NOT KNOWN BUT THAT SHE WAS LEADING THE GOODLY SPEARMAN TO THE FULFILMENT OF HIS HEART'S DESIRE
AND SAW THEM YOKING THE OXEN TO THE PLOUGH
AND SET MEAT AND DRINK IN TWO WALLETS
BUT WAS BUILT VERY STRONGLY AND FAIRLY OF GOOD ASHLAR
MAY WE FILL OUR WALLETS WITH VICTUAL FOR THE WAY SAID THE WARDEN
WHICH NOW SEEMED QUITE NEAR TO HIM AT THE PLAIN'S ENDING
AND NOW THEY NO LONGER CALLED HIM THE SPEARMAN BUT THE WOOD LOVER
AND DEPART WITH NO LEAVE TAKINGS
THAT THE VANQUISHED SHOULD SERVE THE VANQUISHER YEAR LONG
THOU SHOULDST HARDLY ESCAPE FROM THIS ISLE UNSLAIN
NOW LET THEM STAND FORTH AND GIVE OUT THE PRIZE OF VICTORY WHICH THE VANQUISHED SHALL PAY TO THE VANQUISHER
AND WERE CUMBERED WITH CERTAIN SCREES
AND THEREIN THE DEFTEST OF MEN
WOULD THEY SIT LONG HOURS ABOUT THE HOUSE FIRE WITH THE KNIFE OR THE GOUGE IN HAND
THESE SHEPHERD FOLK WERE STRONG AND TALL LIKE THE WOODLANDERS
AND WOULD SEND FOR THE WOODLANDERS
WHEREAS THEIR OWN HILLS AND BENTS AND WINDING VALLEYS WERE NOT PLENTEOUSLY WATERED
SCORING AND NICKING AND HAMMERING
AND THE HOUSES OF THE KINSHIPS LAY ABOUT IT
AS THE HOUSEMATES NEEDED
THE INGATHERING OF THE INCREASE
SINCE HEREIN THEY TRUSTED TO THEIR TRUCKING WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE SHEPHERDS
AND OF GREENING WEEDS WAS ABUNDANCE AT HAND
THE REMNANTS AND OFF SCOURINGS OF WICKED AND WRETCHED FOLKS MEN WHO THINK AS MUCH OF THE LIFE OF A MAN AS OF THE LIFE OF A FLY
FOR THE DOOR WAS BUT LATCHED
THE FIRST WAS A WOODLANDER
AS THERE HAD BEEN IN OLD TIME LONG SCREES FROM THE CLIFF
ALDERMAN'S SON
THOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD NOTED NO SLOT OF MEN
BUT NO OTHER SIGN OR SLOT OF MAN WAS THERE
AND THE HALF BLIND PATH OR SLOT STILL LED PAST THE CLOSE THICKETS AND FALLEN TREES
BUT COULD HEAR NO SOUND SAVE THE MOANING OF THE WIND IN THE PINE BOUGHS AND THE CHATTER OF THE STARLINGS ABOUT THE GABLES OF THE HOUSE
FOR STILL HE MISDOUBTED THAT SHE WAS A GODDESS
BUT LET HER GO HER WAYS UNTHANKED
AND THE SLOT LED US INTO THE WOOD
WHO WAS A GOOD WOODSMAN AND LIFTED THE SLOT FOR US
NOW THE FULL TIDINGS OF THE RANSACKING WERE THESE
AND HAD HAD TIME TO NOTE WHO THE RANSACKERS WERE
NOR DID THEY LEAVE ANY SLOT
NO DOUBT HAD GOLD MANE BUT THAT THESE RANSACKERS WERE HIS FRIENDS OF THE MOUNTAIN
AND MEN WENT ON SKIDS WHEN THEY FARED UP AND DOWN THE DALE OR ON THE MOUNTAIN
WHO WAS THE DEFTEST OF ALL MEN OF THAT TIME AND COUNTRY
AND EACH MAN THERE HAD HIS SKIDS AND HIS BOW AND QUIVER
THEY WENT MERRILY ON THEIR SKIDS OVER THE CLOSE LYING SNOW
FOR HE WAS ON THE DEEP SNOW IN HIS SKIDS
MEANWHILE OF HIS TARRYING THE ARCHER LOOSED AGAIN AT HIM
AND THE ARCHER CAME SWIFTLY TOWARDS HIM ON HIS SKIDS WITH NO WEAPON IN HIS HAND SAVE HIS BOW
LET US GET DOWN INTO THE WOOD WHERE WE CAN DO OFF OUR SKIDS AND SIT DOWN
THERE THEY TOOK OFF THEIR SKIDS
AND THEN ON SKIDS OVER THE HARD SNOW ALONG THE DALE'S EDGE TILL HE WAS COME TO THE WATCH TOWER
AS FOR THE BRIDE SHE WAS SAD AND MORE THAN MISDOUBTED ALL
BUT A LITTLE BEFORE MARCH WAS BORN CAME NEW TIDINGS FROM THE WOODLANDERS
AND THEY CRAVED A MEAL'S MEAT AND LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
AND THE WOODLANDERS
AND MUCH PEOPLE OF THE WOODLANDERS WAS IN THE HALL
WHICH INDEED HE WAS EAGER TO UNWRAP AT ONCE
SO HE WENT ALONG THE HIGHWAY A LITTLE TILL HE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE WAS A FOOTBRIDGE OVER INTO THE MEADOW
AND IN A LITTLE WHILE HE LIFTED THE SLOT AND THEY DEPARTED
AND THEY STOOD ON THE TOP OF A LONG STONY SCREE
HE WENT LIGHTLY DOWN THE SCREE
THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHINETH NEVER IN THE WINTER
AND FIRST OF ALL WITH THE WOODLANDERS
AND HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MOSTLY COME FROM THE HOUSES OF THE WOODLANDERS
HOW MUCH SLENDERER AND SMALLER AND WEAKER SHE SEEMED IN HIS EMBRACE THAN HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER
AND THERE STOOD EIGHTY AND SEVEN MEN ON THE GRASS BELOW THE SCREE AND FOLK MIGHT THEIR CAPTAIN
AND IN ALL GUISES THESE FELONS
THOU SHALT YET SEE ME AS THE SLAIN'S CHOOSER WOULD SEE HER SPEECH FRIEND
FOR DALE WARDEN WAS A GOOD SWORD AND THE DALESMAN AS FIERCE OF MOOD AS MIGHT BE
SO HE SENT THE THRUST OF HIS SPEAR CRASHING THROUGH THE FACE AND SKULL OF THE SMITER
I WILL TELL THEE THAT I FOUND THERE NO MARVELS OR STRANGE WIGHTS
FOR ONE OF THE WOODLANDERS A KEEN HUNTER HAD TOLD US OF THEIR LAIR
WHERE HALF A SCORE WOODLANDERS JOINED THEMSELVES TO US
FOR THE WOODLANDERS LED US BY CROOKED PATHS
AND WOULD NOT TAKE UP THE SLOT
AND A WOODLANDER
A WOODLANDER
AND STROVE TO OVERMASTER HER GRIEF
BEGRUDGING ALL THAT SWEETNESS OF LOVE
NOR DO I THINK THAT I SHALL BLENCH IN THE BATTLE
SHE HAD BEEN BRUISED AND SORE MISHANDLED
FOR THE SMOKE RISETH THICK IN THE MORNING AIR
MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN GRIEVOUSLY MISHANDLED
AND THEY SET THEM DOWN ON THE GRASS AND MADE THEMSELVES THEIR CARVERS AND SERVING MEN
FOR MY MASTER HAD BEEN MISHANDLING ME
MANY AN EVE WE FEARED TO MORROW THE UNBEGUN UNFINISHED DAY
THOU BEAREST WITH THEE BOTH ILL LUCK AND GOOD
TILL THEY WERE ASSURED BY MEETING A BAND OF THE WOODLANDERS
AND HE DEEMED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BLENCHING IN THEM
AND HE FARED ON THENCE TO THE WOODLANDERS
THIS IS RED WOLF OF THE WOODLANDERS LEADING THE MEN WHO GO UNDER THE SIGN OF THE WAR SHAFT
AND OF THE WOODLANDERS TWO HUNDREDS AND NINE
AND THEY MINGLED WITH THE GOOD FOLK OF THE DALE AND THE SHEPHERDS AND THE WOODLANDERS
VALIANT SCOURERS OF THE WILD WOOD
AND THE CHAPMAN'S CHEEK PALED
THAT I AM NOT SACKLESS TOWARD THEE AND THINE
THEY WOULD BE WORN AND WORSENED BY OUR USE OF THEM
AND TO THE SHEPHERDS AND THE WOODLANDERS
AND THEY ARE NOW WARNED BY THE OVERTHROWS AND SLAYINGS THAT THEY HAVE HAD AT OUR HANDS THAT WE ARE ASTIR
I AM SACKLESS BEFORE THEM
THE FRONT WAS ALL OF GOOD ASHLAR WORK
AND BEHELD THE PLACE OF THE WOODLANDERS THAT IT WAS EMPTY
ART THOU OUR FRIEND O DAY DAWN'S LOVER
AND AMIDST IT ALL THE WOODLANDERS NOW STOOD SILENT
AN OUTLANDER
IT IS BUT SOOTH THAT THE RANSACKERS AND THE SLAYER MAY SOON BE KNOWN
AND ACCOUNT THEM TO BE SACKLESS BEFORE US
TO SPEAK HEREOF
AND THEY WILL FOLLOW HIM WHERESOEVER HE LEADETH
FOR OF LATE HE HAD BEEN MUCH AMONG THE WOODLANDERS
AND THE DAY OF OUR HOSTING
YE SHEPHERDS AND WOODLANDERS
EVERY MAN SHALL BE DULY SUMMONED TO THE HOSTING
SO THE WOODLANDERS TILTED THEMSELVES IN
AND SO CAME ON TO THE STONY SCREE AT THE END OF THE PASS AND INTO THE VALE
PRESENTLY THERE WAS A GREAT THRONG GATHERED ROUND ABOUT THE WOODLANDERS
AND TOOK AN OLD MAN OF THE WOODLANDERS BY THE HAND
THE WOODLANDERS WENT FIRST INTO THE PASS
AND THEREON SOME OF THE WOODLANDERS CRIED OUT JOYOUSLY THAT THE WATERS WERE RUNNING NORTH
AND WITH HIM UPWARDS OF TWO SCORE AND TEN OF THE BOWMEN OF THE WOODLANDERS AND THE WOLF HUNTSMEN
WHO SET OFF AFTER HIM DOWN THE SLOPE WITHOUT MORE TARRYING
WHETHER THEY BE OF OUR FOLK OR THE WOODLANDERS
AND ALL THEY NOTCHED AND LOOSED WITHOUT TARRYING
FOR ANOTHER TWO SCORE MEN OF THE WOODLANDERS HAD CREPT DOWN THE HILL TO THEM
THESE MADE NO TARRYING ON THAT SPACE OF THE DEAD
THEN DREW THOSE HEWERS OF THE DALE TOGETHER
NOW THE BANNERS OF THE WOLF FLAPPED AND RIPPLED OVER THE HEADS OF THE WOODLANDERS AND THE MEN OF THE WOLF
AND RUSHED FURIOUSLY ON THE ARRAY OF THE WOODLANDERS
THE WOODLANDERS MET THEM SHOUTING OUT
THE SMITER
AND SOME WERE OVERTHROWN AND TRODDEN DOWN AS THEY STROVE TO HOLD FACE TO THE WOODLANDERS
IS IT THUS THEN THAT ENDETH MAN'S DAYS ON MID EARTH
DOWN SHINETH THE SUN ON THE WAR DEED HALF DONE
FOR NOW HAD THE WOODLANDERS ALSO LEARNED IT
EVEN SO WISELY FOUGHT THE WHOLE BAND OF THE WOODLANDERS AND THE WOLVES
AND THOUGH THEY TURNED ABOUT TO MEET THE STORM OF THE WOODLANDERS
BUT STILL THE WOODLANDERS AND THE WOLVES CAME ON
BUT PRESENTLY THE SPACE BETWIXT THE WOODLANDERS AND THE MEN OF THE FACE WAS CLEAR OF ALL BUT THE DEAD
AND THE WOODLANDERS WITHAL
AND WHEN THEY SAW THEMSELVES SO MEETLY ORDERED
WITH MANY OF THE SWAINS AND THE WOMEN OF THE WOODLANDERS
THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE HALL SAVE TWO WOMEN OF THE WOODLANDERS
WHAT SHINETH OVER THE FALLOW SWORDS
AND ESPECIALLY OF THE WOODLANDERS
IF THEY SEE US FARING BACK GIFTLESS THROUGH THE WOODS
AND THE MEN OF THE WOLF AND THE WOODLANDERS
YET WERE THERE AMONGST THE WOODLANDERS THOSE WHO WEPT WHEN THEY SAW THEIR FRIENDS VERILY DEPARTING FROM THEM
SOME BORE SLENDER SHAFTED SPEARS
WAS THE OBTAINMENT OF A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY SUBJECT CONNECTED WITH ITS WELFARE
A DUTCH GUILDER TWO SHILLINGS
THE CRIMINAL ADDICTION TO THE USE OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS HAD BECOME SO ROOTED
BY SOME MEANS AS YET UNACCOUNTED FOR
NOT COGNIZABLE
UNDER THE PENALTY OF FORFEITING THEIR LICENCES AND RECOGNIZANCES
LIKEWISE TO ENTER INTO FURTHER RECOGNIZANCES
UNDER THE PENALTY OF FORFEITING BOND AND RECOGNIZANCES
ALL APPLICATIONS RESPECTING DETAINERS AGAINST PERSONS LEAVING THE COLONY
OTHERWISE NOT COGNIZABLE
UNLESS THE APPELLANT GIVES GOOD SECURITY TO PROSECUTE IT
OR ITS DEPENDENCIES
TO ADMIT NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSON ON BOARD WITHOUT A PASS AT ANY TIME
HOSPITAL SERVANTS FORBID VENDING OR PRESCRIBING MEDICINES
IDLERS LOITERING ABOUT THE WHARFS TO BE SENT TO HARD LABOUR
THEY WILL FORFEIT THEIR LICENCE AND RECOGNIZANCES
PERSONS NEGLECTING TO ATTEND MUSTERS
UNDER THE PENALTY OF FORFEITING THE BOND AND RECOGNIZANCES ENTERED INTO AT THE TIME THEIR LICENSE WAS GRANTED
STILLS PROHIBITED TO BE USED
NONE BUT KNOWN HOUSEHOLDERS TO PASS
UNDER THE PENALTY OF FORFEITURE OF RECOGNIZANCES HE ENTERS INTO AT THE TIME HE IS APPOINTED TO THAT SITUATION
TO BE FINALLY SETTLED QUARTERLY OTHERWISE NOT COGNIZABLE
AND HAVE REMAINED SO TOTALLY UNINFORMED AS TO THE NATURE OF A COUNTRY
BEING DRIVEN INTO BATEMAN'S BAY BY BAD WEATHER
BY MEN NAMED BROWN AND KENNY
I BELIEVE I HAVE TOUCHED UPON THE MOST INTERESTING POINTS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS YET UNMATURED SETTLEMENT
SO THAT EVERY GRAZIER HAS NOW AN OPPORTUNITY OF FEEDING HIS STOCK THEREON
GLITTERING IN THE SUN DAZZLES THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER WITH ITS UNMATCHED LOVELINESS AND LUSTRE
AND TWO STUFFED SPECIMENS ARE TO BE SEEN IN MISTER BULLOCK'S MUSEUM
WITH SOME GINGERS
PERFUMING THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE
THE FIRST IS GENERALLY USED FOR BONDING OF SPIRITS IN
AND THUS TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THE POWER OF THOSE INIQUITOUS DESIGNERS
AND THUS CONTROVERTS THE NATURAL AND NECESSARY DISTINCTIONS OF SOCIETY
AND THUS MAKING THEM THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE SUITS WHICH THEY WERE PERMITTED TO INSTITUTE
IN POINT OF QUALITY AND SUITABLENESS FOR THE CLIMATE
AND BEING IN THE CUSTOM OF COHABITING WITH PERSONS IN AFFLUENT CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THE SHIP WAS COMPLETELY FUMIGATED
WHOSE EDUCATIONS HAVE TAUGHT THEM TO LOOK ABOVE SITUATIONS TO WHICH UNFORESEEN AND UNAVOIDABLE CALAMITY MAY HAVE REDUCED THEM
UNDER CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS WHICH SHOULD PREVENT HIM FROM ABSTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES
PERSONS OF UNIMPEACHED MORAL CHARACTER FOR NOTHING COULD BE MORE IMPOLITIC IN ANY CASE THAN TO IMPORT PERSONS OF DOUBTFUL CHARACTERS INTO A COLONY OF THIS DESCRIPTION
I HAVE MYSELF HEARD OF NO BEING SUBSTITUTED FOR YES AND WHAT GUARANTEE CAN THERE BE FOR THE OBTAINMENT OF JUSTICE
IT ALSO DISBURDENS ITSELF OF THE WEIGHT OF SUPPORTING THEM AND OF PROVIDING THEM CLOTHING
AND THE NUMEROUS DESERTIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE AMONGST THOSE CONVICTS WHO HAVE NO PROSPECT OF AMELIORATION IN VIEW
UNILLUMINED BY A SINGLE RAY OF HOPE
MIGHT BE PAID BY DUTIES LAID ON IMPORTATIONS
IT IS USUALLY IN CONNECTION WITH IT THAT OUR EARLIEST SUPERPHYSICAL EXPERIENCES TAKE PLACE
NOT THE PHYSICAL BODY WHICH ON THIS PLANE CRYSTALLIZES IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
IT MAY BE OBJECTED BY SOME READERS THAT NO SUCH COMPLEXITIES AS THESE ARE DESCRIBED BY MOST OF THE PSYCHICS WHO OCCASIONALLY GET GLIMPSES OF THE ASTRAL WORLD
THE IMMENSE VARIETY OF THESE ENTITIES MAKES IT EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE AND TABULATE THEM
THAT ALL SUCH LODGES ARE AT LEAST AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE GREAT HIMALAYAN BROTHERHOOD
BUT OF WHATEVER GRADE THE ENTITY'S INTELLECT MAY BE
AND THEREFORE IT OSCILLATES BETWEEN THE TWO ATTRACTIONS
AND THE CONSEQUENT WASTE OF TIME AND PROLONGATION OF THE INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO INCARNATIONS
AND EVEN IF THIS BE AVOIDED THE NATURAL PROCESS OF THE TRIAD FREEING ITSELF IS RUDELY DISTURBED
THEY GRATIFY THEIR LOATHSOME PASSIONS VICARIOUSLY THROUGH A MEDIUM OR ANY SENSITIVE PERSON WHOM THEY CAN OBSESS
FROM THIS CLASS AND THE LAST ARE DRAWN THE TEMPTERS
THERE SLOWLY TO DISINTEGRATE AFTER EXPERIENCES BEST LEFT UNDESCRIBED
ANY WOUND INFLICTED UPON THE ANIMAL MATERIALIZATION WILL BE REPRODUCED UPON THE HUMAN PHYSICAL BODY BY THE EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON OF REPERCUSSION
AND AS SOON AS ITS IMPULSE HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT IT SINKS BACK INTO THE UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS OF THAT PARTICULAR SUBDIVISION OF ELEMENTAL ESSENCE FROM WHICH IT CAME
IT HAS LONG BEEN THE CUSTOM TO PITY AND DESPISE THE IGNORANCE OF THE ALCHEMISTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES
THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OUR DESPISED FOREFATHERS' ANALYSIS WENT SEVERAL STEPS DEEPER THAN OUR OWN
FOR WHILE IT IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOM TO PASS WITH ALMOST INFINITE SLOWNESS THROUGH ITS VARIOUS HORIZONTAL CLASSES AND SUBCLASSES IN SUCCESSION
AND THEN THE ELEMENTALS WERE FRIENDLY
THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE CHANGED THOUGHT WHICH CONTINUALLY IMPINGES UPON THEM
MANY WRITERS HAVE INCLUDED THESE SPIRITS AMONG THE ELEMENTALS
AND INDEED THEY ARE THE ELEMENTALS OR PERHAPS
FEELS AND BELIEVES WHATEVER THE MAGNETIZER WISHES
NOT EVEN THE HIGHEST POSSESS A PERMANENT REINCARNATING INDIVIDUALITY
THEIR HOSTS HAVE HITHERTO BEEN RECRUITED CHIEFLY FROM OTHER HUMANITIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
THEIR ATTENTION CAN BE ATTRACTED BY CERTAIN MAGICAL EVOCATIONS
THEY ARE OFTEN SPOKEN OF AS THE REGENTS OF THE EARTH
REFERENCES TO THEM ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE SYMBOLOGY OF EVERY RELIGION
ALL THE HIGHER NATURE SPIRITS AND HOSTS OF ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS ACT AS THEIR AGENTS IN THE STUPENDOUS WORK THEY CARRY OUT
ELEMENTALS FORMED UNCONSCIOUSLY
MOST PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ARE SO FLEETING AND INDECISIVE THAT THE ELEMENTALS CREATED BY THEM LAST ONLY A FEW MINUTES OR A FEW HOURS
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT AMONG THE ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS MANY TERRIBLE CREATURES ARE TO BE SEEN
MOVES THROUGH THE WORLD CARRYING WITH HIM EVERYWHERE A PESTIFEROUS ATMOSPHERE OF HIS OWN
BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACTION OF ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS
ONE FROM WHICH THERE IS PRACTICALLY NO LEAKAGE
ELEMENTALS FORMED CONSCIOUSLY
ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS OF GREAT POWER MAY BE CALLED INTO EXISTENCE
THE ART OF MANUFACTURING ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS OF EXTREME VIRULENCE AND POWER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE SPECIALITIES OF THE MAGICIANS OF ATLANTIS
THE MOVEMENT THEY THUS SET ON FOOT GRADUALLY GREW INTO THE VAST FABRIC OF MODERN SPIRITUALISM
AND SO SPIRITUALISM GREW AND FLOURISHED
THOUGH ON THE OTHER HAND SOME INVESTIGATORS OF SPIRITUALISM HAVE REMARKED ON THE FACT THAT AFTER A CONSIDERABLE LAPSE OF TIME CERTAIN DIFFERENCES SUDDENLY BECAME OBSERVABLE IN THE MANNER AND DISPOSITION OF A SPIRIT
THOUGH IN THE COURSE OF THIS PAPER VARIOUS SUPERPHYSICAL PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AND TO SOME EXTENT EXPLAINED
EITHER THAT GHOST MUST MATERIALIZE
IT IS OFTEN ONLY ON THAT OCCASION THAT THE ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS HE CREATES ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO MATERIALIZE THEMSELVES TO ORDINARY SIGHT
AND EVEN MATERIALIZATIONS
OR MAY OBSESS AND SPEAK THROUGH AN ENTRANCED MEDIUM
OF THESE INTERMEDIATES
THERE IS A VAST STORE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY WHICH HAS BECOME DORMANT IN MATTER DURING THE INVOLUTION OF THE SUBTLE INTO THE GROSS
ANOTHER PHENOMENON CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THIS PART OF THE SUBJECT IS THAT OF REDUPLICATION
WOULD PROCEED TO OBJECTIFY THE WRITING AS BEFORE DESCRIBED
IS WHAT IS CALLED LEVITATION
OCCULT SCIENCE IS ACQUAINTED WITH A MEANS OF NEUTRALIZING OR EVEN ENTIRELY REVERSING THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY
AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT BY THE JUDICIOUS USE OF THIS POWER ALL THE PHENOMENA OF LEVITATION MAY BE EASILY PRODUCED
THE PRINCIPLE OF SYMPATHETIC VIBRATION MENTIONED ABOVE ALSO PROVIDES THE EXPLANATION OF THAT STRANGE AND LITTLE KNOWN PHENOMENON CALLED REPERCUSSION
INVOCATION OF ELEMENTALS
SHE WEEPINGLY REPLIED
STRIPPED OFF WITH EAGERNESS THEIR DOUBLETS HOSE
I WOULD NOT GIVE A DENIER FOR YOUR LIFE
AND SEIZE HIS SWORD TO STRIKE OFF HIS FOE'S HEAD
CAN HE WHO SUES FOR MERCY GAIN IT AT THY HANDS
A LARGE KNIFE PENDED FROM HIS GIRDLE
AND AS THE YEOMAN'S RIGHT ARM PRESSED HIM MOST WITH ENERGY HE CLUTCHED IT IN HIS GRASP
HE FIXED WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE YEOMAN'S LEFT
BUT AS HE TURNED HIM FROM HIS FOOTLESS FOE
AS EACH BY TURNS HAD BEEN THE YEOMAN'S PREY
RAISING MEANWHILE HIS ARM THE LEPER'S HAND HE SEVERED AT A BLOW
THE MOTHER AND THE HANDLESS LEPER TOLD THEIR TALE IN TURN
REMOVED THE BRIDLE FROM HIS CHARGER'S MOUTH
WILT THOU ALLOW ME TO SLEEP ON IN PEACE IF I DO THEE UNHORSE
AT THAT TRUMPET'S CALL EACH IN THE CASTLE AND THE CITY ROSE
HE DREW THE CHARGER'S REIN AND GENTLY SAID
HER HEAD WAS LARGER THAN A PORTAL'S ARCH
AGAIN HE MOUNTED ON HIS CHARGER'S BACK
FRIEND WHAT THOU ASK'ST I'LL TELL THEE IN FEW WORDS
IF THAT HIS ACTS DID NOT UPRAISE HIM MORE THAN WORDS CAN EVER REACH
THEN THEY SET OUT FOR CARLISLE'S GALLANT COURT
A LARGE BEAK SHARPER THAN A RAZOR'S EDGE
WHILE THE FAIR LADY AND HER VASSALS KNELT AND MADE THIS ORISON
WHO HAD BEEN CHRISTENED BENITA AFTER HER MOTHER AND BEATRIX AFTER HER FATHER'S ONLY SISTER
BENITA SHOOK HER HEAD
WHOSE NAME LIKE MINE AND HER MOTHER'S WAS BENITA
DROVE TO DURBAN
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A HEAP OF GOLD BEADS AND BANGLES
SAID BENITA RELIEVED
AND BENITA STOPPED
OF WHICH BENITA HAD SPOKEN
FOLLOWED AT ONCE BY OTHER RINGINGS THAT MEANT
AND TO SWING SOME OF THEM OUTBOARD
NEXT HE LIFTED BENITA
HOLDING BENITA WITH ONE ARM
WITH BENITA SENSELESS ON HIS BREAST
YET BENITA WOULD APPROVE OF SUCH A DEATH AS THIS
HE WONDERED WHETHER BENITA WOULD LIVE AND WHAT SHE WOULD SAY
COMPANIONED BY HIS WILD
AND ITS FOAM BEGAN TO RETURN SEAWARDS
STAGGERED FORWARD WITH THAT TIGERISH WATER HISSING AT HIS HEELS
THE BOAT IN WHICH BENITA LAY
NOW THEY MADE GOOD PROGRESS SEAWARDS
BENITA'S INJURIES WERE NOT OF A REALLY SERIOUS NATURE
BENITA OBEYED FOR SHE FELT HUNGRY THEN REPEATED HER QUESTION
ASKED BENITA IN A LOW VOICE
SHE SAID FALLING ON HER KNEES BY BENITA
BENITA LOOKED AT HER AND ANSWERED VERY GENTLY
THE CASTLE ARRIVED OFF DURBAN AND ANCHORED
THE FOLLOWING WEEK WAS VERY MUCH OF A BLANK TO BENITA
BUT YOU SEE BENITA WE SHALL NOT BE QUITE ALONE THERE
SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TRADING AMONG THE ZULUS
BENITA SMILED
SHE ASKED FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF MISTER CLIFFORD'S FARM
BENITA AND HER FATHER PERCEIVED
BY THE TIME THAT THE WESTLEY RICHARDS WAS DRAWN FROM ITS CASE AND LOADED
UP SLOPES AND DOWN SLOPES THAT REMINDED BENITA OF THE BAY OF BISCAY IN A STORM
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE MAN'S PERSONALITY WHICH REPELLED AND ALARMED BENITA
MURMURED BENITA
HALF AN HOUR LATER BENITA
SHE TOLD BENITA THAT HER FATHER WAS STILL IN BED
BENITA ASKED WHO HAD ORDERED THE BOX TO BE UNPACKED
NOTHING SEEMED DEAD AND HOPELESS EXCEPT BENITA'S HEART
SHE COUNTED THE GAME TREKKING ALONG THE RIDGE TILL HER MIND GREW WEARY
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THERE BENITA NEVER DISCOVERED
BENITA'S CURIOSITY OVERCAME HER
ANSWERED BENITA IN AN INDIFFERENT VOICE
WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CHIEF MAMBO
BUT THE OLD PRIEST'S FOREFATHER WHO KNEW THE SECRET ENTRANCE TO THE PLACE
BENITA DID NOT SEE OR HEAR THEM HER SOUL WAS FAR AWAY
THE WHITE LADY SAID SO IN THE TIME OF MY FOREFATHER
THE SPIRIT OF THE WHITE WOMAN WHO KILLED HERSELF BEFORE THE EYES OF MY FOREFATHER HAS BEEN SEEN OF LATE STANDING UPON THE POINT OF ROCK
IT REMAINED UPON THE POINT OF ROCK AND MY FOREFATHER TOOK IT THENCE
THE LIVING BENITA OF TO DAY
WHAT DO YOU SAY BENITA
COMMENTED BENITA
AND MEANWHILE BENITA MADE READY FOR HER JOURNEY
THEY HAD NONE OF THE BRAVERY OF THE ZULUS
WHOSE NAME WAS MAMBO
WOULD BE MAMBO ON HIS FATHER'S DEATH
WILD LIFE HAD AGREED WITH BENITA EXTRAORDINARILY WELL
WHILE BENITA COOKED THE FOOD WHICH THE TWO WHITE MEN SHOT
AND BENITA
LOOKING AT THEM BENITA COULD WELL UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAME ABOUT THAT THE POOR FUGITIVE PORTUGUESE HAD CHOSEN THIS AS THEIR LAST PLACE OF REFUGE
AND BENITA SAW THAT THEY WERE OF THE SAME STAMP AS THE MESSENGERS TALL AND GOOD LOOKING
WHILE BENITA WONDERED AT HIS WORDS
THEN HE LIFTED HIS WITHERED HAND AND HELD IT TOWARDS BENITA SAYING
BENITA ROSE ALSO
WHEN SUDDENLY BENITA
BUT THE THREE MEN MARCHED ON UNHEEDING TILL THEY STOOD BEFORE MAMBO
AND BENITA HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY TO HIS COMPANIONS
AT THE MAN'S WORDS ABOUT BENITA
BENITA FELT THAT THE ACT WAS JUST AND THE AWFUL PUNISHMENT DESERVED
AND THERE WAS SILENCE SO INTENSE THAT BENITA THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE SCRAPING OF THE FEET OF A GREEN LIZARD WHICH CREPT ACROSS A STONE A YARD OR TWO AWAY
STAGGERED BACK TO WHERE BENITA STOOD HORRIFIED AT THIS DREADFUL SCENE
MAMBO THESE MEN ARE MESSENGERS SPARE THEM
SAID BENITA IN ZULU
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO BENITA
BENITA LOOKED AT HER FATHER IN QUESTION
BROKE IN BENITA WITH AGITATION
BENITA WHAT DO YOU SAY
BENITA THOUGHT A MOMENT
YET LONG AGO INSTINCT OR INSIGHT HAD CAUSED BENITA TO SUSPECT THE WORKINGS OF HIS MIND
BENITA WAS MET BY HER FATHER
WHICH SECRETLY BENITA HOPED SHE MIGHT NEVER BE CALLED UPON TO EAT
SAID BENITA CONTEMPLATING THIS PERILOUS ASCENT WITH DISMAY
IN HER RELIEF BENITA KISSED HIM
BENITA MADE NO ANSWER
TO THE ENTRANCE OF A CAVE WHICH WAS PLACED ALMOST AT THE FOOT OF THE MONOLITHIC CONE
BENITA HUNG BACK A LITTLE
AT FIRST BENITA COULD NOT SEE MUCH
BENITA BOWED HER HEAD AND CROSSED HERSELF
BENITA SHUDDERED
BENITA UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR
SAID BENITA WITH A LITTLE SMILE
ANSWERED BENITA
SAID BENITA
BUT BENITA
SINCE THENCEFORWARD BENITA
WHOSE PERCEPTIONS APPEARED TO BENITA TO BE LESS KEEN THAN FORMERLY
BY THIS TIME BENITA WAS CONFIDENT THAT
INFORMATION AT WHICH BENITA COULD NOT HELP BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER
BENITA PLANS ESCAPE THE NEXT MORNING
AND SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MENTAL INTIMACY HAD COME HOME TO BENITA
BENITA FORMED A SUDDEN DETERMINATION
REPLIED BENITA CHEERFULLY FOR SHE HEARD HER FATHER'S FOOTSTEP
STILL BENITA COULD NOT BE RID OF THAT TREASURE
BENITA CEASED TO TAKE THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN THE MATTER
SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE WISHED NEVER TO SEE ANOTHER HUMAN BONE OR ANCIENT BEAD OR BANGLE
WHAT REASON BENITA
ANSWERED BENITA FIBBING BOLDLY
REPLIED BENITA WITH A SMILE
WHAT IT WAS BENITA DID NOT TROUBLE TO INQUIRE
WHO COULD DELVE AMONG DEAD BONES AND IN LIVING HEARTS WITH EQUAL SKILL AND INSIGHT
HE SAID WORDS AT WHICH BENITA SHIVERED
BENITA EXCLAIMED BOLDLY
WHISPERED HER FATHER TO BENITA
FALTERED BENITA
EVEN THEN BENITA DETERMINED THAT IF SHE COULD HELP IT THIS SHOULD NOT BEFALL HER
AND ALTHOUGH THEIR MARKSMANSHIP WAS VILE
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE INCREASING LAMENESS OF MISTER CLIFFORD'S MARE
TO BENITA'S INTENSE RELIEF
EVER THEREAFTER IT WAS BENITA'S FAVOURITE NIGHTMARE
AND BENITA RUNNING AT HIS SIDE
AS IT APPEARED TO BENITA
BENITA SANK TO THE GROUND
ASKED BENITA
SUGGESTED BENITA
MURMURED BENITA
SAID BENITA
STOPPING NOW AND AGAIN TO BOW TO BENITA
YOU SEE BENITA WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
AND BENITA KNEW THAT SHE WAS THE PREY WHOM HE DESIRED
BENITA BETHOUGHT HER OF THE FAIRY TALES OF HER CHILDHOOD
BENITA CHANGED THE SUBJECT ASKING HIM IF HE HAD MADE ANY DISCOVERIES
BENITA SHRANK FROM HIM VISIBLY
BROKE IN BENITA IN A STERN VOICE FOR HER ANGER HAD OVERCOME HER FEAR
ASKED BENITA BEWILDERED
YOU MEAN THAT YOU WANT TO MESMERIZE HER AS YOU DID THE ZULU CHIEF
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MESMERIZED IN MY LIFE
ANSWERED BENITA
ANSWERED BENITA
SAID BENITA
THEN WILL YOU ALLOW HIM TO TRY TO MESMERIZE YOU
MISTER CLIFFORD ATTEMPTED TO MESMERIZE HIS DAUGHTER
IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THIS THAT OF A SUDDEN BENITA DID FEEL SOMETHING
BENITA HEARD NO MORE OF MESMERISM
AT THE FIRST BREAK OF DAWN ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER MISTER CLIFFORD'S ATTEMPT AT MESMERISM
THE FIRE SLACKENED AND BENITA GREW PALE WITH FEAR
SAID BENITA WITH A SHUDDER
AND BENITA WAS FILLED WITH DESPAIR
AND BENITA NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS TOOK HIS RIFLE OR A PISTOL WITH HIM
BENITA CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE MUST BE DEAD
BENITA COULD SWALLOW NO FOOD
BENITA CRIED A LITTLE NOW THAT HER FATHER COULD NOT SEE HER
BUT BENITA NEITHER HEARD NOR SAW
AND THE ENTRANCED BENITA SAT HERSELF DOWN UPON THE STEPS AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS
WHILE THE SPIRIT HE HAD EVOKED IN THE BODY OF BENITA LIVED THROUGH THOSE AGES
FOR HE WAS AWARE THAT BENITA KNEW NO PORTUGUESE
AND HE POINTED TO BENITA
WHEN I AWOKE AGAIN THE MAMBO AND HIS MEN STOOD ABOUT ME
AND THE HAND OF THE LIVING BENITA WAS LIFTED
SAID THE VOICE OF BENITA
DID HER FATHER WATCH BY THE BED OF BENITA
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER BENITA JOINED HIM
WELL LAST NIGHT HE DID MESMERIZE YOU
BENITA WHEELED ROUND UPON THE STONE ON WHICH SHE SAT
HITHERTO BENITA HAD SAT SILENT
YOU MUST LET ME MESMERIZE YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES ONLY
THEREFORE I MUST MESMERIZE YOU AGAIN
THE NEXT THREE DAYS WERE PASSED BY BENITA IN A STATE OF CONSTANT DREAD
BUT I WISH TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOUR MIND AS TO BEING MESMERIZED
BENITA WOULD TURN AND RUN FROM HIM AS FROM A WILD BEAST
NOR DID BENITA ALWAYS LISTEN IN VAIN
BEFORE IT WAS DAWN BENITA AND HER FATHER
THEN BENITA SAID
AND BENITA GOING TOWARDS THE GREAT CONE
BENITA OF A SUDDEN FOUND HERSELF SUFFUSED IN LIGHT SO VIVID AND INTENSE THAT
THEN IT OCCURRED TO BENITA THAT
THE FACE OF BENITA FELL
ASKED BENITA
BENITA DREW IT TO THE SIDE OF THE WELL
AND BENITA FELT HER STRENGTH BEGIN TO FAIL
WHY OR WHEREFORE BENITA NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE BREAST OF BENITA
ANSWERED BENITA WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
THE OTHER BENITA
ANSWERED BENITA STUBBORNLY
SAID BENITA WHEN SHE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD GONE
BUT WHAT THEN BENITA
TOWARDS THE END BENITA WAS FORCED TO COMPLETE THE TASK ALONE
WHEN BENITA WOKE THE LAMP HAD GONE OUT AND IT WAS PITCH DARK
BENITA THOUGHT A MINUTE THEN SHE ANSWERED
NOW BEGAN BENITA'S TERRIBLE TIME THE WORST OF ALL HER LIFE
HE WOULD SWALLOW BUT LITTLE OF THE ROUGH FOOD WHICH WAS ALL BENITA WAS ABLE TO PREPARE FOR HIM
BENITA COULD NOT SWALLOW ENOUGH FOOD TO KEEP UP HER STRENGTH
BENITA LOOKED AT HER WATCH
THE LIVING BENITA
THRICE DID THIS MESSAGE APPEAR TO REPEAT ITSELF IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BENITA
BENITA ROSE GASPING
BENITA SHOOK HER HEAD
THEN BENITA PLACED THE REMAINDER OF THE OIL CLOSE BY HER FATHER'S SIDE
BENITA TORE HERSELF AWAY
FLITTED BENITA
AS SHE STOOPED TO LOOK IT CAME INTO THE MIND OF BENITA THAT HER FATHER HAD SAID THAT IN HER TRANCE SHE HAD TOLD THEM THAT ONE OF THE BAGS OF TREASURE WAS BURST
THAT OTHER BENITA HAD DESCENDED HERE WITH HER FATHER
YET AS BENITA STOOD THERE PANTING A BLESSED HOPE ROSE IN HER BREAST
NOW BENITA THOUGHT THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD
THEN BENITA BEGAN HER JOURNEY WHICH
AND LOBBED AWAY ACROSS THE RIVER
BENITA HOPED NOT FOR ONE DAY SHE HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF CROCODILES
ELFISH FACE OF BENITA
AND CRAWLING FORWARD DOWN THE CARTEL BENITA FELL UPON HIS BREAST
BENITA KNEW THAT CHIEF
ROBERT SEYMOUR'S DRIVER
SAID BENITA
WITH A TRAGIC GESTURE THAT IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE MADE BENITA LAUGH
BY THIS TIME THE STORY OF BENITA
ANSWERED BENITA
FOLLOWED BY THE TWO ZULUS
ANSWERED BENITA SOFTLY
ANSWERED BENITA
AND AFTER HIM THE TWO ZULUS
TILL AT LENGTH BENITA CLAMBERED OUT OF THE TRAP DOOR ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE TREASURE CHAMBER
BUT BENITA I DON'T THINK HE IS
WHEN IT WAS NEARLY DOWN THE ZULUS WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS AN ENEMY OUTSIDE
WHILE BENITA WAITED WITH A BEATING HEART
BENITA WAS ABLE TO BEAR NO MORE
THE TWO BIG ZULUS HOLDING HIS ARMS AND LEGS
BENITA RAN INTO THE CAVE AND RETURNED PRESENTLY WITH A TIN OF WATER
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP MISS CLIFFORD'S NAME OFF YOUR LIPS
NO BENITA HE SHALL SEE WHETHER I AM A LIAR
YET AND THIS WAS THE GHASTLIEST PART OF IT FROM THEM THERE CAME NO SOUND
ANSWERED BENITA FAINTLY
THERE WERE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BARRICADE THAT BENITA HAD BUILT WITH DESPERATE HANDS
AS THEY DREW NEAR BENITA PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
SAID BENITA
LAID ONE WITHERED HAND UPON THE HEAD OF BENITA
FIRST STILLS EACH SOUND
SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO CARE MUCH ABOUT HER PARENTS' NEW LODGER
THE DIXONS CAME DROPPING IN
WITH THE DONOR'S NAME UNKNOWN
HE EVEN SEEMED STRONG ENOUGH TO UNDERTAKE THE JOURNEY TO DUNHAM
SO CHANGED WAS HE SINCE THE DIXONS HAD LAST SEEN HIM
THEY SLUNG FRANKY AS IN A HAMMOCK
HIS ROMPS HIS GAMES HIS SICKENING HIS SUFFERING HIS DEATH
STRANGELY ISOLATED DAY AT DUNHAM PARK
AND DRUDGED HER FINGERS TO THE BONE
JUST LIKE A CHAIR DRAWN HEAVILY AND GRATINGLY ALONG A KITCHEN FLOOR
THE HUSBANDS UNBURDENED THEIR MINDS TO THEIR WIVES
OR COOLNESSES
SHE WAS TOO FAITHFUL TO REPINE
EXPECTING A HEARTY CRYING FROM SOFTY JACK HIMSELF HAD CRIED LOUDLY AT HIS LAST BEATING
I SHALL BE BETTER LOVE PLEASE GOD WHEN I COME BACK FROM SOUTHPORT
AND GO OFF TO SOUTHPORT QUIET AND CHEERFUL
BUT SHE WISHED HER THREE WEEKS AT SOUTHPORT WERE OVER
NEVER MIND DIRTYING ANYTHING JENNY
HE WAS SO BUSY WHITTLING AWAY AT A PIECE OF WOOD
SHE GOT ME MY RIGHT SORT OF WOOD FOR WHITTLING
THE DOCTOR DID SAY SO MUCH ABOUT HER GOING TO SOUTHPORT BEING THE ONLY THING FOR HER
AND ARRANGE WITH A KIND FRIEND I HAVE AT SOUTHPORT ALL ABOUT SENDING HER HOME
HE RETURNED TO THE LITTLE DOOR WHERE IN THE GLOOM HE FOUND HIS MYSTERIOUS CONDUCTRESS WAITING FOR HIM ON THE FIRST STEPS OF A WINDING STAIRCASE
AND ANY INDISCRETION ON HER PART MIGHT BRING HITHER A DOMICILIARY VISIT WHICH WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE TO ALL PARTIES
THE KENNELS OF THE UPPER TOWN SWOLLEN BY THESE CONTINUED LOTIONS BECAME RIVERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CITY AND THE PAVEMENT GENERALLY VERY MUDDY IT MUST BE ALLOWED TOOK A CLEAN FACE AND ABSOLUTELY SHONE IN THE FRIENDLY RAYS OF THE SUN
WHAT HAD FIRST STRUCK THE KING WAS A CERTAIN CONTRAST IN THE VOICES OF THE TWO INTERLOCUTORS
IF THAT DOVE'S HEART SO EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO PAINFUL EMOTIONS HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE CRUEL WORDS OF MADAME OR THE EGOTISTICAL COLD SMILE OF THE KING IT WOULD HAVE ANNIHILATED HER
IS THAT WHAT DISSATISFIES YOU MONSIEUR
THE PARISIANS HIT LIKE CYCLOPS WITH AN ENSEMBLE AND A TACTIC DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD
FOR WHOM DID YOU DESTINE THEM MY LORD I WILL CONCEAL NOTHING FROM YOU
IT WAS MONK'S BUSINESS THEN TO SEIZE THE FRENCHMAN IN THE ACT OF FALSEHOOD AND TRICK AND TO DRAW FROM THE FALSE STEP ITSELF IN WHICH HIS ENEMIES WISHED TO ENTRAP HIM A TRIUMPH FOR HIS RENOWN
THE FISHERMAN OBEYED BUT NOT WITHOUT NOTCHING HIS CUTLASS
MONK SURPRISED THIS FLASH AND IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED IT BY ONE OF THOSE SILENT SMILES WHICH ALWAYS CAUSED HIS INTERLOCUTORS TO KNOW THEY HAD MADE NO INROAD ON HIS MIND
IN FACT DURING THE GENERAL'S ABSENCE LAMBERT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN BATTLE CONQUERED AND DISPERSED THE PARLIAMENT'S ARMY AND TAKEN WITH HIS OWN THE PLACE OF MONK'S ARMY DEPRIVED OF ITS STRONGEST SUPPORT
MONK MADE HIS CALCULATIONS AT A THOUSAND DESERTIONS A DAY LAMBERT HAD MEN ENOUGH TO LAST TWENTY DAYS
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THAT WAS SO TERMED WHICH WE NOW CALL ROYALISM
AND HE PROMPTLY EXPEDITED HIS COURT TO RETURN TO HIS FRENCHMEN AS HE CALLED THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE MY LORD REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN PHLEGMATICALLY I CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF NO MAN
HIS THOUGHTS WERE EMPLOYED THEREFORE ALL THE WAY ON THE ROAD FROM HIS PRESENTATION WITH ONE THING AND THAT WAS HOW HE SHOULD CONCILIATE A MAN LIKE MONK A MAN WHOM CHARLES HIMSELF KIND AS HE WAS CONCILIATED WITH DIFFICULTY
NOW GENERAL MONK WHEN HE PARDONED ME FOR HE HAS PARDONED ME COULD NOT HELP REPEATING THESE WORDS TO ME WHICH I CHARGE EVERY ONE OF YOU TO ENGRAVE DEEPLY THERE BETWEEN THE EYES UNDER THE VAULT OF THE CRANIUM
IT WAS HERE HE LEARNED THE ART OF DRAWING UP AN ACCOUNT AND THE MUCH MORE VALUABLE ONE OF COMPLICATING IT
WHY SHOULD YOU NOT DESIRE THAT IT HAS BEEN PRINTED THAT TO GAIN THAT OBJECT I HAD SOLD CAMBRIA TO THE SPANIARDS
WITH THE EMOLUMENTS OF THE CARDINALSHIP AND THE MINISTRY I SAY TOO LITTLE WHEN I SAY TWO MILLIONS A YEAR
BUT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD WE MUST GO EVEN TO EXCEPTIONS EVEN TO IMPROBABILITIES
GRANTED MONSIEUR GRANTED SAID THE MAN LOOKING INTO THE EYES AND THE FACES OF THE TWO INTERLOCUTORS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THERE WAS PROFITABLE OR DISADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF IN TELLING THE TRUTH
BUT IT IS AN AXIOM OF CURIOSITY THAT EVERY MAN WHO WISHES TO QUESTION WELL AND FRUITFULLY OUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO LAY HIMSELF OPEN TO QUESTIONS
THIS CIDER GIVES ME THE HEARTBURN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE TOPOGRAPHER BLUSHING TO THE TOP OF HIS EARS
MY FRIEND YOU ARE NOT ONLY A HERCULEAN TOPOGRAPHER YOU ARE STILL FURTHER A DIALECTICIAN OF THE FIRST WATER
BRAVO SAID D'ARTAGNAN THAT REDOUBLES MY DESIRE TO SEE MY DEAR OLD FRIEND
IT IS THE PRINCIPAL OF THE COLLEGE OF THE JESUITS AND THE SUPERIOR OF THE DOMINICANS
HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SHOW FOUR QUARTERINGS
THIS WAS A FRESH MISFORTUNE FOR BUCKINGHAM WHO FANCIED HE PERCEIVED IN MADAME HENRIETTA'S LOOK A DEEPER FEELING THAN THAT OF CURIOSITY
WE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNERS TOGETHER
WHY DO YOU DISTILL INTO THE HEART OF THE MAN YOU TERM YOUR FRIEND ALL THE BITTERNESS THAT INFECTS YOUR OWN
WHAT HARM I ASK YOU CAN THERE BE IN A MAN GIVING TO HIS COUNTRYWOMAN A RECEIPT FOR A NEW ESSENCE
YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN THE DISCREETNESS I HAVE SHOWN INTO CONSIDERATION ALTHOUGH YOU WERE INTERESTED IN REMAINING SILENT
FOR A MAN SO PURITANICALLY CONSCIENTIOUS AS YOU ARE WHO CAN REPROACH AN OLD SOLDIER FOR A YOUTHFUL FREAK FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENED WILL ALLOW ME TO ASK WHETHER YOU WHO ADVOCATE SUCH EXCESSIVE PURITY OF CONSCIENCE WILL UNDERTAKE ON YOUR SIDE TO DO NOTHING CONTRARY EITHER TO CONSCIENCE OR THE PRINCIPLE OF HONOR
BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR THAT YOUR RECONCILIATIONS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL
THE TIME MONSIEUR SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE HAUGHTIEST DISDAIN SIMPLY TO COUNT THE MONEY
AND WHEN THIS ANOINTMENT WAS COMPLETED HE HAD HIMSELF WRAPPED IN FLANNELS AND PLACED IN A WARM BED
IF OBLIGINGNESS IS THE VOCATION OF FINANCIERS CHARITY IS THE VIRTUE OF THE CLERGY
SELDON I SEEM TO KNOW THAT NAME
HER DEEP MUSINGS MELANCHOLY THOUGH THEY WERE WERE NOT UNTINGED WITH A CERTAIN VAGUE JOY
SHE ADDED REFASTENING THE BODY OF HER DRESS
THE RIGHT OF QUASHING ALL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN AGAINST ANY FRENCHMAN WHO IS NEITHER KING NOR PRINCE
A VULTURE HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AND BEING HUNGRY BROKE THE TORTOISE'S BACK WITH A BLOW OF HIS BEAK AND DEVOURED IT
SHE TOOK A PASS KEY FROM HER POCKET AND OPENED THE DOOR OF HER MAID OF HONOR'S APARTMENT
DUMB AND NOW COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER FOR HIM NOW TO LEARN AND HE FOLLOWED HIS PITILESS CONDUCTRESS AS BLINDLY AS THE CULPRIT FOLLOWS THE EXECUTIONER
CONSEQUENTLY WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS OF A FATHER ABOUT TO START HIS CHILDREN IN LIFE HE CANDIDLY INTERROGATED HIMSELF WHETHER THE PUBLIC WOULD FIND THESE OFFSPRINGS OF HIS IMAGINATION SUFFICIENTLY ELEGANT AND GRACEFUL
SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN A TONE SO NATURAL AND UNASSUMED THAT THERE WAS NO MEANS OF SUSPECTING THAT HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS FEIGNED
HE HAD NARROWLY EXAMINED BOTH THEIR COUNTENANCES AND HE HAD KNOWN THEM BOTH FOR A SUFFICIENTLY LONG PERIOD TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THROUGH THE MASK OF THEIR IMPASSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS THE MATTER
IF NOTHING DETAINS HIM LONGER IN PARIS
WHILE SEVERAL PLATES STILL UNEMPTIED SHOWED THAT THE PRISONER HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED HIS EVENING MEAL
WITH EVERY OPENING PETAL THEY UNFOLD THE TREASURES OF THEIR PERFUMES FILLING MY CHAMBER WITH A FRAGRANCE THAT EMBALMS IT
BUT THE LIGHT WHICH BEAMED IN HIS EYES FADED AWAY AND HE COLDLY AND DISTRUSTFULLY WITHDREW HIS HAND AGAIN
AN ACCOUNT WHICH FEW INDEED COULD NOW AVOUCH
THE ONE THIS MINIATURE PORTRAYS OR WHOM THE GLASS REFLECTS
NEVERTHELESS THIS MAN HELD UP HIS HEAD TOO OFTEN TO BE VERY PRODUCTIVELY EMPLOYED WITH HIS FINGERS
AN EPICUREAN'S DRESS
BUT AS AT LA FONTAINE'S DECLARATION THE OTHERS HAD TURNED ROUND MOLIERE KEPT UPON HIS LIPS THE RALLYING SMILE WHICH HAD SO NEARLY DIED AWAY AND CONTINUING TO MAKE LA FONTAINE SPEAK
THE BISHOP JUST TRENCHED ON THE BORDERS ONLY OF LICENSE IN HIS STYLE OF CONVERSATION
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS NOT FRANCOIS WHO WAS WRONG IN DEMURRING BUT YOU WHO ARE IN THE WRONG IN NOT LISTENING TO HIM
YOU SAID SELDON I THINK
I SAID SELDON OF COURSE
NO NO SELDON
THAT THE WAX LIGHTS CHANGED INTO THE TAPERS OF A MORTUARY CHAPEL THE VERY GLASSES OF WINE INTO CHALICES OF BLOOD
THICK CLOUDS PORTENDING A TEMPEST OVERSPREAD THE HEAVENS AND SHROUDED EVERY LIGHT AND PROSPECT UNDERNEATH THEIR HEAVY FOLDS
A GENTLE EASY MOVEMENT AS REGULAR AS THAT BY WHICH A VESSEL PLUNGES BENEATH THE WAVES HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE IMMOVABLENESS OF THE BED
TO FLOAT INDECISIVELY IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE MYSTERY BETWEEN RESEMBLANCE AND REALITY
HE SHOUTED WITH INCREASING HOARSENESS
WE DO NOT PRETEND TO SAY THAT SUCH RHETORIC IS ALWAYS BAD AND ALWAYS SCATTERS IN PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO GROW THE FLOWERS WITH WHICH IT EMBELLISHES AND ENLIVENS HISTORY
BUT CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN STRENGTH WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY THE FORCE OF AN OVERPOWERINGLY RESOLUTE DETERMINATION HE WAITED UNTIL SOME DECISIVE CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD PERMIT HIM TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF
BUT AT ALL EVENTS THE KING HAS SEEN THE RECEIPTS AND HE CAN DO NO OTHER THAN BELIEVE YOU ARE INCRIMINATED
THAT THIS POOR PRINCE WAS THE UNHAPPIEST OF HUMAN BEINGS WHEN HEAVEN WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE OVER ALL HIS CREATURES UNDERTOOK TO COME TO HIS ASSISTANCE
A MAN WHO WILL PREVENT YOU CONSUMMATING YOUR CRIME
SELDON IS FREE
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD BE FAR FROM OFFENDING GROUNDLESSLY THE VERY ONE OF YOUR SERVANTS WHO HAS RENDERED YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICE OF ALL
LOVE ABSOLVES EVERYTHING RAOUL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GALLERY THE PRISONER STOPPED FOR A MOMENT TO CONTEMPLATE THE INFINITE HORIZON TO RESPIRE THE SULPHUROUS PERFUMES OF THE TEMPEST TO DRINK IN THIRSTILY THE HOT RAIN AND TO BREATHE A SIGH RESEMBLING A SMOTHERED GROAN
THE HORSE EAGERLY RESPIRED THE SALT SHARP PERFUME OF THE MARSHES
ALL AT ONCE THEY HEARD THE RAPID APPROACH OF A HORSE'S STEPS AND FIRST BELIEVED IT TO BE ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR REPERCUSSIONS WHICH DECEIVE THE EAR AT EVERY TURN IN A ROAD
IN VAIN DID THE NOISE DEAFEN THE EAR OF THE FATHER THE SMOKE OBSCURED THE CHERISHED OBJECT OF HIS ASPIRATIONS
HE WAS POLITE AS A BRAVE MAN ALWAYS IS AND HIS TERRIBLE REPUTATION HAD CONCILIATED AS MUCH FRIENDSHIP AMONG THE MEN AS ADMIRATION AMONG THE WOMEN
BUT I WILL IMPROVISE ONE
REPLIED LOUIS ACRIMONIOUSLY
IN PROPORTION AS THE TALE ADVANCED THE KING BECAME AGITATED DEVOURING THE NARRATOR'S WORDS AND DRUMMING WITH HIS FINGER NAILS UPON THE TABLE
THEN I SUPPOSE IT IS A ROYAL FLEET BLOCKADING THE COASTS
ADDED HE ON SEEING THAT ALL PREPARED TO OBEY HIM EXCEPT THE SURVEILLANT OFFICER
D'ARTAGNAN DISTINCTLY SAW THE LAND OF FRANCE PROFILED IN BLACK AGAINST THE WHITE CLOUDS OF NIGHT
THE KING IS THE MANDATORY OF GOD
FROM AN UNREFLECTIVE INSTINCTIVE MECHANICAL FEELING THE LIEUTENANT CRIED
THE THREE FIRST COMPARTMENTS BECAME ONE SEPULCHRAL SINK INTO WHICH FELL GRIMLY BACK IN THE ORDER OF THEIR WEIGHT EVERY VEGETABLE MINERAL OR HUMAN FRAGMENT
THEN OSCILLATED DECLINED AND FELL SUCCESSIVELY THE MIGHTY MONOLITHS OF ROCK WHICH THE VIOLENCE OF THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO UPROOT FROM THE BED OF AGES
HE WENT OUT QUICKLY FOR FEAR OF COMPLICATING THE AFFAIR BY A DISPLAY OF PREMATURE ILL HUMOR
AND WE KNOW THAT HIS PREVISIONS WERE IN GENERAL CORRECT
AFTER AFFRONTS AND INJUSTICES I HAVE A COMMAND WHICH WAS FORMERLY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT GAVE THE BEARER THE RIGHT OF SPEAKING AS HE LIKED TO HIS KING
SCARCELY WAS THE KING REINSTALLED IN PARIS WHEN HE RECEIVED A TOUCHING PROOF OF THIS
THE PHYSICIAN MADE TWO SUCCESSIVE BLEEDINGS WHICH DISLODGED IT FOR THE TIME BUT LEFT THE PATIENT VERY WEAK AND WITHOUT POWER OF ACTION IN ANYTHING BUT HIS BRAIN
INSTEAD OF EMBROILING ME WITH YOUR BROTHER CHARLES YOU MUST MAKE HIM A MORE INTIMATE FRIEND THAN EVER
BUT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE KING WOULD HAGGLE WITH YOU
NOT ABLE TO WRITE SHE SENT FOR THE PARISH PRIEST WHO WROTE A LETTER FOR HER AND THIS WAS GIVEN TO ABBE FORTIER TO BE SENT OFF BY THE POST
MEAN AS SHE WAS SHE FELT THE DISGRACE BEFALLING HER AS IF SHE DROVE HER NEXT OF KIN TO THIS STEP
NAY GOOD MASTER GILBERT SAID THE PIOUS DAME FORGET NOT THAT WE HAVE THE FATHER OF THE FATHERLESS ABOVE AND THAT HE HAS PROMISED THAT A SWALLOW SHALL NOT BE SOLD FOR A PENNY WITHOUT ITS BEING SPENT FOR THE ORPHAN'S SHARE
HE HAD NOT PRESAGED HOW THE TEMPEST WOULD FALL
I WILL ASK FATHER FORTIER TO LOCK YOU UP ON BREAD AND WATER FOR A FORTNIGHT AND HAVE HER PUT IN A NUNNERY IF SHE CANNOT MODERATE HER FANCY FOR YOU
THE TEACHER PUT ME OUT BECAUSE I MADE TOO MANY BARBARISMS AND SOLECISMS WHICH PREVENT ME OF HAVING ANY CHANCE TO WIN THAT PURSE
MY AUNT AND FATHER FORTIER HAVE REPEATED A HUNDRED TIMES THAT I AM GOOD FOR NOTHING
I SHOULD RATHER THINK HE WAS AND BY THE SAME TOKEN I HAVE TAKEN MANY FLOGGINGS FOR HIM
THE LAD WAS PLUNGED INTO A THOUGHTFUL MOOD WHICH WOULD HAVE MUCH PUZZLED TEACHER FORTIER THE LOGICAL MAN
ONLY CATHERINE EVER COPED WITH HIM AND SHE WAS HUSHED WHEN HE FROWNED
YOU HAVE TURNED OUT A STRAPPER MY LAD
HOW MUCH DID YOUR AUNT GIVE OLD FORTIER NOTHING
IT WAS CATHERINE COME DOWN AT LAST WHO WAS MAKING CAUTIONARY SIGNS TO HIM
YOU APPEAR MUCH ABOVE THE CONDITION YOUR CLOTHES BESEEM SAID THE STRANGER
THIS UNREFLECTED REPLY IN WHICH BILLET BETRAYED HIMSELF BY CONFESSING THAT HE NOT ONLY KNEW THE AUTHOR WHICH WAS NATURAL BEING HIS LANDLORD BUT THE BOOK
BUT IT IS NOT HE WHO CASHES UP THIS TRIP
COME COME YOU ARE NOT SUCH A DUNDERHEAD AS I THOUGHT
THE INCREASE OF CURIOSITY DURING THE HALT WAS SUCH THAT MORE HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE POOR ANIMAL'S BURDEN AND SHE HAD SUNK UNDER THE SURCHARGE
THE SHOCK THE LATTER FELT WAS FROM NECKER'S BUST FALLING FROM WANT OF A HOLDER ON THE FARMER'S HEAD
THE IRON HURRICANE CLEFT A LONG SWATH OF BLOOD THROUGH THE MASS
TEN THOUSAND GUNSHOTS POURED UPON THE FORT AT RISK OF SLAYING THE ASSAULTERS WITH THE GARRISON
THAT WILL BE TWO TRIUMPHS FOR THE REVOLTERS IN ONE DAY
ON THE BLACKENED WALLS THE BULLET GRAZES STOOD OUT WHITE AND WERE ABOVE COUNT
AS HE COULD NOW MESMERIZE ANDREA HE COULD MENTALLY MASTER MOST MEN
HE HUGGED HIS LIBERATORS EXALTED THEIR VICTORY AND RELATED HIS CAPTIVITY
AND THEN A HEAD SEVERED FROM THE TRUNK ROSE DISGUSTINGLY ON THE TIP OF A PIKE
HE REMEMBERED THE SIGN IN THE ORDER OF THE INVISIBLES
THE PALACE AND SURROUNDING SITES WERE PACKED WITH TROOPS BUT GILBERT MANAGED TO REACH THE BULLS EYE CHAMBER WHERE NECKER'S LETTER PASSED HIM INTO THE ROYAL PRESENCE
YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID THE KING HIS LIPS BLANCHING AFTER A TRANSIENT BLUSH AND PERSPIRATION APPEARING ON HIS BROW
I MAY LOUDLY SAY THAT YOUR MAJESTY IS DEFAMED WHEN EVIL IS ATTRIBUTED TO YOU AND CITE MYSELF AS EXAMPLE
SINCE HEAVEN GAVE ME THE CHARGE OF BODIES I HAVE SHED MY BLOOD FOR MANKIND AND STAUNCHED ITS FLOW IN OTHERS
NO MORE SHIFTING AND SUBTERFUGES CRIED GILBERT FEELING THAT HE WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION
I AM GILBERT OF THE CRIME THE LIBELS THE CASKET AND YOU THE REAL GREAT LADY OF THE COURT
AS ANDREA RESISTED THE MAGNETIZER TOUCHED THE CROWN OF HER HEAD WITH HIS PALM SAYING
BUT HE CONCENTRATED HIMSELF ON THIS PRIVATE SPECULATION AND RETURNED TO SEE THE MESMERIZER AND THE MEDIUM
AWAKEN IN FIFTEEN MINUTES ORDERED THE MESMERIZER TO THE LADY
THESE CRIES FLATTERED MARIE ANTOINETTE'S SECRET ASPIRATIONS AND SHE MEANT TO PROFIT BY THEM
THE OFFICERS DID NOT THINK THIS GASTRONOMICAL EXERCISE WORTHY OF A HERO AND LOOKED ON AS LITTLE RESPECTFUL AS THEY DARED TO BE
THE QUEEN BLUSHED AND HER FRETFULNESS WAS DISPLAYED IN ALL HER MOVEMENTS
ARE THESE GENTLEMEN ALL BELLICOSE TOO HE ASKED WITH A TRANQUILLITY ALMOST BEATIFIC
YOU RUN DANGERS FROM THE RAGE OF A PEOPLE WHO ARE UNCURBED
DO NOT SPEAK OF THE NOBLES' BLOOD RETURNED THE COUNT THE COMMONERS HAVE BLOOD TO SHED ALSO
THEY SANG IN THE SHOWERS OF GRAPESHOT WHILE HANDLING UNFAMILIAR WEAPONS AND THE OLDEST GRENADIERS WOULD NOT MAKE A CHARGE WITH THAT LIGHTNESS
DO YOU FORGET THAT I AM A MAN OF MY WORD AND THE ENGAGEMENT I MADE IT IS THE OATH THAT GOADS ME FOR IN IMMOLATING YOURSELF TO MY HAPPINESS YOU GIVE GRIEF TO A FAIR AND NOBLE WOMAN
THE SWORD HE SHARPENED WILL HAMSTRING YOUR FINEST WAR HORSE
YES BUT THE SPARTANS ARE NEARLY A MILLION AND IT IS YOUR ARMY THAT IS XERXES
BUT SHE DARED NOT DIRECT HER EYES AGAIN ON THE MAGNETIZER
BUT IF THE KING HAS NEED OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCALPEL AND DRUGS I CAN BE AS GOOD A HEALER AS HUMAN SCIENCE ALLOWS ONE OF OUR RACE TO BE
BY VIRTUE OF YOUR QUACKERY AND CHARMS
BUT THE DEEPEST EMOTIONS DID NOT LONG HOLD THE MESMERIZER IN THEIR SPELL
AH MADAM DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POWER IS I HAD FROM THE MASTER WHOM YOU DEFAMED
THE KING SCREAMED MARIE ANTOINETTE WITH DREAD REVEALING RATHER THE WIFE THAN THE MEDIUM RELUCTANT TO MAKE A SCENE FOR THE SPIRITUALIST
THE MORE EASY AS THEY KNOW YOU AND THAT YOU WOULD TURN THE OTHER CHEEK TO THE SMITER
MARIE ANTOINETTE'S BURST OF AFFECTION IN RECEIVING HER HUSBAND ON HIS RETURN FROM PARIS HAD OPENED THE EYES OF THE COUNT
KING OR SUBJECT ALL HAVE A FLAW IN THE IRON HEART THROUGH WHICH PIERCES TERROR WHEN BOLDNESS ELOPES
AT DIFFERENT PERIODS IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD CALL THIS HAUNTER OF HIS DREAMS BY DIFFERENT NAMES
HE IS CAREFUL TO ENLIGHTEN US CONCERNING THE PRECURSORS AND PREREQUISITES TO THE ADVENT OF THIS HIGHEST TYPE IN REFERRING TO A CERTAIN PASSAGE IN THE
WE REQUIRE FOR A NEW END ALSO A NEW MEANS NAMELY A NEW HEALTHINESS STRONGER SHARPER TOUGHER BOLDER AND MERRIER THAN ALL HEALTHINESS HITHERTO
AS LIKEWISE HOW IT IS WITH THE ARTIST THE SAINT THE LEGISLATOR THE SAGE THE SCHOLAR THE DEVOTEE THE PROPHET AND THE GODLY NON CONFORMIST OF THE OLD STYLE
REQUIRES ONE THING ABOVE ALL FOR THAT PURPOSE GREAT HEALTHINESS
SUCH HEALTHINESS AS ONE NOT ONLY POSSESSES BUT ALSO CONSTANTLY ACQUIRES AND MUST ACQUIRE BECAUSE ONE UNCEASINGLY SACRIFICES IT AGAIN AND MUST SACRIFICE IT
THE IDEA OF REVELATION IN THE SENSE THAT SOMETHING BECOMES SUDDENLY VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WITH INDESCRIBABLE CERTAINTY AND ACCURACY WHICH PROFOUNDLY CONVULSES AND UPSETS ONE
EVERYTHING HAPPENS QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AS IF IN A TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURST OF FREEDOM OF ABSOLUTENESS OF POWER AND DIVINITY
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO PRESENT ITSELF AS THE READIEST THE CORRECTEST AND THE SIMPLEST MEANS OF EXPRESSION
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER ASKED ME AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA PRECISELY MEANS IN MY MOUTH IN THE MOUTH OF THE FIRST IMMORALIST
FOR WHAT DISTINGUISHES THAT PHILOSOPHER FROM ALL OTHERS IN THE PAST IS THE VERY FACT THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF AN IMMORALIST
EVEN THE WISEST AMONG YOU IS ONLY A DISHARMONY AND HYBRID OF PLANT AND PHANTOM
POISONERS ARE THEY WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT
THE MAN LOOKED UP DISTRUSTFULLY
BUT THEY ARE THE REAPERS AND REJOICERS
WITH THE CREATORS THE REAPERS AND THE REJOICERS WILL I ASSOCIATE
FOR OVERCOMING IS BITTERNESS AND BADLY SLEEP THE UNRECONCILED
HE WHO LEADETH HIS SHEEP TO THE GREENEST PASTURE SHALL ALWAYS BE FOR ME THE BEST SHEPHERD
AND WHAT WERE THE TEN RECONCILIATIONS AND THE TEN TRUTHS AND THE TEN LAUGHTERS WITH WHICH MY HEART ENJOYED ITSELF
WHAT ARE THESE PRANCINGS AND FLIGHTS OF THOUGHT UNTO ME
BUT THEY CHANGED AT LAST INTO BIRDS AND CHARMING SONGSTRESSES
MAY THEY PREACH DESISTANCE FROM LIFE AND PASS AWAY THEMSELVES
FLEE THITHER WHERE A ROUGH STRONG BREEZE BLOWETH
AND THITHER WHERE A ROUGH STRONG BREEZE BLOWETH
BUT I AM DISTRUSTFUL OF YOUR DOGGISH LUST
HIS DEATH DIETH THE CONSUMMATING ONE TRIUMPHANTLY SURROUNDED BY HOPING AND PROMISING ONES
A PRAISE SHALL THEY BE AND A JUSTIFICATION OF ALL PERISHABLENESS
SAITH THE EVIL DEED THAT IS ITS HONOURABLENESS
WHERE THESE MEET THERE ARISETH THE BLUSTERER THE
GREATER ONES VERILY HAVE THERE BEEN AND HIGHER BORN ONES THAN THOSE WHOM THE PEOPLE CALL SAVIOURS THOSE RAPTUROUS BLUSTERERS
THE RING'S THIRST IS IN YOU
HOW INEPTLY COMETH THE WORD
THE HOLY WATER HAVE THEY POISONED WITH THEIR LUSTFULNESS
AND HOLDING MY NOSE I WENT MOROSELY THROUGH ALL YESTERDAYS AND TO DAYS
WOULDST THOU SEE THE TARANTULA ITSELF
AND THEY THEMSELVES WERE FORMERLY THE BEST WORLD MALIGNERS AND HERETIC BURNERS
THERE HATH THE TARANTULA BIT ME MYSELF MINE OLD ENEMY
AND IF HE BE A DANCER HE IS NOT AT ALL A TARANTULA DANCER
YE WOULD FIRST HAVE TO BREAK YOUR VENERATING WILL
A REFRESHMENT TO HOT HANDS AND HANDLERS
AND YOU YOURSELVES WOULD I BLESS YE TWINKLING STARLETS AND GLOW WORMS ALOFT
UNPITYINGLY DOTH IT PURSUE ITS COURSE
THEN DID YE CHANGE MY NIGH ONES AND NEAREST ONES INTO ULCERATIONS
THE UNEXHAUSTED PROCREATING LIFE WILL
SHOULD HE BECOME WEARY OF HIS SUBLIMENESS THIS SUBLIME ONE THEN ONLY WILL HIS BEAUTY BEGIN
AND ONLY WHEN HE TURNETH AWAY FROM HIMSELF WILL HE O'ERLEAP HIS OWN SHADOW
THE HIGHER IT RISETH
THE SUPERHERO
FROM ALL MOUNTAINS DO I LOOK OUT FOR FATHERLANDS AND MOTHERLANDS
UNSETTLED AM I IN ALL CITIES AND DECAMPING AT ALL GATES
YET STILL CAN I SAY THEREWITH THE TRUTH TO DISSEMBLERS
NOW RISETH THE DESIRE OF THE SEA WITH ITS THOUSAND BREASTS
GOOD CLOCKWORKS ARE THEY ONLY BE CAREFUL TO WIND THEM UP PROPERLY
THUS DID THEY DEAFEN THE SOUND OF MY TREAD
ON THESE DO WE SET OUR GAUDY PUPPETS AND THEN CALL THEM GODS AND SUPERMEN
ALL THESE GODS AND SUPERMEN
AND FAIN WOULD THEY THEREBY PROVE THEMSELVES RECONCILERS
THAT IS A KIND OF STATE AND INDEED THE MOST MENDACIOUS
OR A FULFILLER
TO YOU THE DARING VENTURERS AND ADVENTURERS AND WHOEVER HATH EMBARKED WITH CUNNING SAILS UPON FRIGHTFUL SEAS
AND THIS SLOW SPIDER WHICH CREEPETH IN THE MOONLIGHT AND THIS MOONLIGHT ITSELF AND THOU AND I IN THIS GATEWAY WHISPERING TOGETHER WHISPERING OF ETERNAL THINGS
THESE MEDIATORS AND MIXERS WE DETEST
AND WHEN THEY CHANCE TO SPEAK HARSHLY THOSE SMALL PEOPLE THEN DO I HEAR THEREIN ONLY THEIR HOARSENESS
VERILY THIS ART AND THIS WINTER ROGUISHNESS HAVE I LEARNT WELL
HERE AND THERE THERE IS NOTHING TO BETTER NOTHING TO WORSEN
TO ME HOWEVER DID THE HEART WRITHE WITH LAUGHTER AND WAS LIKE TO BREAK
THAT TOOK PLACE WHEN THE UNGODLIEST UTTERANCE CAME FROM A GOD HIMSELF
THE SCORNER OF ALL UNCERTAIN VIRTUE
AND THERE IS ALSO WISDOM THAT IS SUBMISSIVE AND DOGGISH AND PIOUS AND OBSEQUIOUS
RATHER IS IT OF ALL ARTS THE FINEST SUBTLEST LAST AND PATIENTEST
ALMOST IN THE CRADLE ARE WE APPORTIONED WITH HEAVY WORDS AND WORTHS
VERILY LIKE PENITENTIAL PREACHERS AND FOOLS DID I CRY WRATH AND SHAME ON ALL THEIR GREATNESS AND SMALLNESS
MUST THERE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE NIMBLE THE NIMBLEST
GAY COLOURED LIKE THE FLAMINGO
EVEN THROUGH WALLS BLOWETH MY FREE BREATH AND IN INTO PRISONS AND IMPRISONED SPIRITS
THE STUPIDITY OF THE GOOD IS UNFATHOMABLY WISE
THOU CHANGE OF EVERY NEED MY NEEDFULNESS
READY AND RIPE LIKE THE GLOWING ORE THE LIGHTNING BEARING CLOUD AND THE SWELLING MILK UDDER
O WILL THOU CHANGE OF EVERY NEED MY NEEDFULNESS
THOU WOULDST SPEAK AND WITHOUT TREMBLING BUOYANT RATHER WITH BLISS FOR A GREAT WEIGHT AND WORRY WOULD BE TAKEN FROM THEE THOU PATIENTEST ONE
THE HOUR HATH NOW COME FOR THE DOWN GOER TO BLESS HIMSELF
I STRANGLED EVEN THE STRANGLER CALLED
RATHER ONE WHO HATH EVEN UNLEARNT PATIENCE BECAUSE HE NO LONGER
AND WHEN HE HASTILY LOOKED AROUND AND STOOD UP BEHOLD THERE STOOD THE SOOTHSAYER BESIDE HIM THE SAME WHOM HE HAD ONCE GIVEN TO EAT AND DRINK AT HIS TABLE THE PROCLAIMER OF THE GREAT WEARINESS WHO TAUGHT
WHAT WILT THOU HIGHWAY AMBUSHER FROM ME
THOU FALSE COINER
WHAT STRANGE INTERLOCUTORS HAVE I FOUND
BEHOLD THITHER LEADETH THE WAY TO MY CAVE BE TO NIGHT ITS GUEST
THITHER LEADETH THE WAY TO MY CAVE
AFTER THIS GREETING HIS GUESTS BOWED ONCE MORE AND WERE REVERENTIALLY SILENT
THESE SHALL WE SLAUGHTER QUICKLY AND COOK SPICILY WITH SAGE
NOT THE NEIGHBOUR NOT THE POOREST NOT THE SORRIEST NOT THE BEST
THESE PETTY PEOPLE THEY ARE THE SUPERMAN'S GREATEST DANGER
FOR THEY AWAKEN DISTRUST IN GREAT THINGS THESE SUBTLE FALSE COINERS AND STAGE PLAYERS
REFRIGERATED SPIRITS I DO NOT BELIEVE IN
HATH THERE EVER BEEN ANYTHING FILTHIER ON EARTH THAN THE SAINTS OF THE WILDERNESS
THEY ARE CONVALESCENTS
A LITTLE VALIANT NONSENSE SOME DIVINE SERVICE AND ASS FESTIVAL SOME OLD JOYFUL ZARATHUSTRA FOOL SOME BLUSTERER TO BLOW YOUR SOULS BRIGHT
HOW SHE JUST NOW SPEAKETH SOBERLY THIS DRUNKEN POETESS
WHICH COMPELS US HERE TO GIVE A PUBLIC CONTRADICTION TO THE SLANDERERS WHO PRETEND THAT WE LIVE UNDER A GOVERNMENT BUT MODERATELY INDULGENT TO MEN OF LETTERS
A PART IN WHICH HE ACQUITTED HIMSELF WITH HIS USUAL IMPASSIVENESS MUTTERING NEVERTHELESS
THE TWO INTERLOCUTORS THUS SEPARATED TAKING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT FULL GALLOP
ENDOWED WITH A RARE GENIUS FOR INTRIGUE WHICH RENDERED HIM THE EQUAL OF THE ABLEST INTRIGUERS HE REMAINED AN HONEST MAN
BESIDES THIS HE HAD DRAWN UPON HIMSELF TWO GOOD DUELS WITH TWO MEN EACH CAPABLE OF KILLING THREE D'ARTAGNANS
IN AMBIGUOUS WORDS IT IS TRUE BUT RATHER DROLLY AMBIGUOUS
CRIED HE PARODYING A VERSE OF THE BIBLE
FALCONERS ARE DECLINING
BUT AT THIS SORT OF WORK MANY DOUBLETS MUST BE SLASHED AND MANY SWORDS BROKEN
YOU SPEAK OF THE BARONESSES COUNTESSES AND PRINCESSES OF OTHERS
ON THE CONTRARY THAT SIMPLIFIES THE MATTER GREATLY
FROM A DISTANCE RESOUNDED DEADENED HOWEVER BY GOOD SHUTTERS THE SONGS OF THE TIPPLERS ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN THE CABARETS SCATTERED ALONG THE PLAIN
THUS THEN YOU WILL TAKE THIS BAG AND YOU WILL GO AWAY WITHOUT BEING TOO MALCONTENT
YES WHEN THE HOUSE WHERE HE FRATERNIZES IS SUSPECTED
BE KIND ENOUGH THEN MADAME TO ACT MORE COMPLIANTLY
DELIGHTED WITH THIS ASSURANCE THE GOVERNOR COUNTERSIGNED THE PASSPORT AND DELIVERED IT TO D'ARTAGNAN
HERE IS MY PASS COUNTERSIGNED
BUT MY LORD IF THE LORD CHANCELLOR INTERROGATES ME UPON THE MOTIVES WHICH MAY HAVE LED YOUR GRACE TO ADOPT SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY MEASURE WHAT SHALL I REPLY
I HAVE JUST PLACED AN EMBARGO ON ALL VESSELS AT PRESENT IN HIS MAJESTY'S PORTS AND WITHOUT PARTICULAR PERMISSION NOT ONE DARE LIFT AN ANCHOR
IT APPEARS THAT HE HAD MET WITH DISAGREEABLENESS LIKEWISE ON HIS JOURNEY
AND AS HE HAD NO DESIRE TO SUPPORT A POLEMIC DISCUSSION WITH HIS FRIEND'S VALET HE SIMPLY MOVED HIM OUT OF THE WAY WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR OF NUMBER FIVE
I HAD BEEN WARNED BY THE AUTHORITIES THAT A CELEBRATED COINER OF BAD MONEY WOULD ARRIVE AT MY INN WITH SEVERAL OF HIS COMPANIONS ALL DISGUISED AS GUARDS OR MUSKETEERS
I TOOK THEN IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ORDERS OF THE AUTHORITIES WHO SENT ME A REINFORCEMENT OF SIX MEN SUCH MEASURES AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY TO GET POSSESSION OF THE PERSONS OF THE PRETENDED COINERS
SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHOSE EARS CHAFED TERRIBLY UNDER THE REPETITION OF THIS WORD COINERS
COULD YOU NOT PERCEIVE BY OUR APPEARANCE THAT WE WERE PEOPLE OF QUALITY AND NOT COINERS
I HAD BEEN FIFTEEN DAYS WITHOUT SEEING A HUMAN FACE AND HAD BEEN LEFT TO BRUTALIZE MYSELF IN THE COMPANY OF BOTTLES
WHEN THEY MET THEY LOOKED DESOLATELY AT ONE ANOTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY
BUT MADAME HAS NOT CONCILIATED THAT LITTLE WOMAN HE WAS SO FOND OF
THAT IT WAS I WHO CAME TO SEEK YOU AND THAT I DID ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT THIS MISFORTUNE BEFALLING YOU
THE KING WAS DULL AND APPEARED ILL WHICH DETRACTED A LITTLE FROM HIS USUAL LOFTY BEARING
IT WAS THEN RICHELIEU'S OBJECT NOT ONLY TO GET RID OF AN ENEMY OF FRANCE BUT TO AVENGE HIMSELF ON A RIVAL
YES BUT TO WAIT SURROUNDED BY ASSASSINS AND POISONERS
THERE WAS AN INSTANT OF PROFOUND SILENCE BETWEEN THE TWO INTERLOCUTORS
THE MORE SO AS YOU TELL ME THIS D'ARTAGNAN IS A LIBERTINE A DUELIST AND A TRAITOR
I HOPE WHAT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OR ELSE I WARN YOU I WILL NOT PARDON YOU FOR MAKING ME COME HERE INSTEAD OF GETTING A LITTLE REST AFTER A NIGHT SPENT IN TAKING AND DISMANTLING A BASTION
WHAT HATRED SHE DISTILLS
ALL UNDERTAKINGS WHICH A PATIENT AND STRONG MAN MAY ACCOMPLISH BUT BEFORE WHICH THE FEVERISH IRRITATIONS OF A WOMAN MUST GIVE WAY
AND YOU WISH TO INTEREST YOUR JAILERS AND YOUR HANGMEN AGAINST ME
YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT HE DESTINES ME TO A DISGRACE WHICH ALL THE PUNISHMENTS OF THE WORLD CANNOT EQUAL IN HORROR
AT LENGTH HE INTERROGATES ME
OH I SEE YOU PREFER PEREGRINATION
THERE FERMENTED IN THAT SUBLIMATED BRAIN PLANS SO VAST PROJECTS SO TUMULTUOUS THAT THERE REMAINED NO ROOM FOR ANY CAPRICIOUS OR MATERIAL LOVE
THE GLOBE OF FIRE WHICH LIGHTED THE ROOM REASCENDED AND DISAPPEARED
I WENT AND THREW MYSELF ON THE BED WITHOUT PARTING WITH THE EMANCIPATING KNIFE WHICH I CONCEALED UNDER MY PILLOW
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW HE BANISHES ME HE TRANSPORTS ME
THE FIRST FOUR FURLOUGHS GRANTED AS MAY BE IMAGINED WERE TO OUR FOUR FRIENDS
THAT SIGH WAS THE SOUL SO CHASTE AND SO LOVING WHICH REASCENDED TO HEAVEN
WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS A BLACK MASS OF TREES PROFILED ON A STORMY SKY INVADED BY LARGE COPPERY CLOUDS WHICH CREATED A SORT OF TWILIGHT AMID THE NIGHT
HOW MUCH OF THIS ACREAGE CONTAINS AVAILABLE VIRGIN TIMBER HOW MUCH IS MERELY POTENTIAL FOREST HOW MUCH GROWING CROP IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE
THEIR FOREST ACREAGE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION ACRES BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE EVEN UNDER CAREFUL MANAGEMENT AS IN GERMANY MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THEIR NEEDS
ON THE OTHER HAND SUCH COUNTRIES AS THE MEDITERRANEAN PENINSULAS BY THEIR ADVANTAGEOUS SITUATION WITH REFERENCE TO IMPORTATIONS WITH THEIR MILD CLIMATE AND LESS INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE FELT THIS NEED LESS
AGAIN THE STILL POORLY SETTLED AND ORIGINALLY HEAVILY TIMBERED COUNTRIES OF THE SCANDINAVIAN PENINSULA AND THE VAST EMPIRE OF RUSSIA ARE STILL HEAVY EXPLOITERS OF FOREST PRODUCTS AND ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO FEEL THE DRAIN ON THEIR FOREST RESOURCES
AS AGRICULTURE DEVELOPS THE NEED FOR FARMING GROUND OVERSHADOWS THE USEFULNESS OF THE FOREST IN ALL THESE DIRECTIONS AND IT IS CLEARED AWAY
BUT SOON AFTER A GREAT FOREST FIRE STARTING FROM THE PYRENEES RAN OVER THE COUNTRY EXPOSING DEPOSITS OF SILVER ORE WHICH INVITED A LARGE INFLUX OF MINERS THE CAUSE OF RECKLESS DEFORESTATION OF THE COUNTRY
AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE CAUSES OF DEVASTATION WERE AT WORK THE FOREST AREA ALSO INCREASED IN SOME PARTS RECOVERING GROUND LOST DURING WARS AND THROUGH THE NEGLECT OF FARMS BY NATURAL SEEDING
PRIVATE FOREST PROPERTIES CONNECTED WITH FARM ESTATES EXISTED IN ETHIOPIA IN ARABIA AMONG THE GREEKS AND AMONG THE ROMANS AT HOME AS WELL AS IN THEIR COLONIES
ON THE CONTRARY THERE ARE STILL MISMANAGED AND UNMANAGED WOODS TO BE FOUND MAINLY THOSE IN THE HANDS OF FARMERS AND OTHER PRIVATE OWNERS
THE ENGLISH OAK OF WHICH BOTANICALLY TWO SPECIES ARE RECOGNIZED
THE SECOND TO THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGES FIFTEEN HUNDRED DURING WHICH THE NECESSITY OF FOREST MANAGEMENT BEGINS TO BE SPORADICALLY RECOGNIZED
AS STATED THE GERMAN TRIBES WHICH SETTLED THE COUNTRY WERE HERDERS AND HUNTERS WHO ONLY GRADUALLY DEVELOPED INTO FARMERS WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS BEING SETTLED
THE CLOISTERS WERE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE IN COLONIZING AND MAKING FARM LAND WITH THE USE OF AXE AND FIRE SUCH CLOISTERS BEING OFTEN FOUNDED AS MERE LAND SPECULATIONS
WHILE IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES A MERELY RESTRICTIVE AND REGULATIVE OR ELSE A LET ALONE POLICY
THE PLANTING OF HARDWOODS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BEGUN MUCH LATER
UNDER THE EXERCISE OF THESE VARIOUS RIGHTS AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF PROPERTY CONDITIONS THE FOREST CONDITIONS NATURALLY DETERIORATED CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
FOR COOPERAGE ONLY THE TOP DRY OAK
THIS WAS DONE ESPECIALLY BY INTERDICTING SALE TO OUTSIDERS FORBIDDING EXPORT FROM THE SMALL TERRITORY OF THE PARTICULAR PRINCE
THIS WAS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE SUPPLANTED BY GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION OF THE WOODYARDS
IN PRUSSIA TO PREVENT OVERCHARGES THE JEWS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE WOOD TRADE IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY ONE
ARTIFICIAL REFORESTATION
THE REMNANTS OF THESE POOR PASTURE WOODS WITH THEIR GNARLY OAKS HAVE LASTED INTO MODERN TIMES
HE DIVIDES THE FOREST INTO PROPORTIONAL AREAS WHICH WERE MARKED BY STONES IN THE WOODS EQUALIZING THEM ACCORDING TO AGE QUALITY INCREMENT SOIL EXPOSURE SO AS TO SECURE EQUAL ANNUAL BUDGETS
THE MERCHANTABLE STOCK WAS ASCERTAINED BY A SAMPLE AREA METHOD AND THE FELLING BUDGET BY DIVIDING THE OLDEST AGE CLASS BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT MUST LAST UNTIL THE NEXT WAS READY
THE FIRST ELABORATION OF A PURE VOLUME DIVISION WAS MADE BY BECKMAN IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE
ONLY WHEN THE DIVISION INTO EQUAL OR PROPORTIONATE FELLING AREAS BECAME THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE FELLING BUDGETS DID THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH SURVEYS PRESENT ITSELF
OF A FORESTRY SCIENCE ONE COULD HARDLY SPEAK UNTIL AN ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO ORGANIZE THE KNOWLEDGE THUS EMPIRICALLY ACQUIRED INTO A SYSTEMATIC PRESENTATION AND THIS WAS NOT DONE UNTIL THE MIDDLE OR LAST HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
TWO CONTINUATIONS OF THE MAGAZINE UNDER DIFFERENT EDITORSHIPS WERE OF LESS VALUE
AN INCREASE OF THE STATE'S PROPERTY CAME ALSO DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF THE CENTURY THROUGH THE ABOLISHMENT OF CLOISTERS AND SECULARIZATION OF CHURCH PROPERTY GENERALLY THE LANDS OF BOTH PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC CHURCH INSTITUTIONS BEING TAKEN BY THE STATE
OF REGULATING FELLING BUDGETS AND BECAME ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF FOREST STATICS EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX WHICH HE CALLED
THE DOCTRINE OF MEASURING FORESTAL FORCES
HE ALSO INVENTED AN INGENIOUS PLANTING IRON OR DIBBLE A HALF CONE OF IRON WHICH WAS THROWN BY THE PLANTER WITH GREAT PRECISION FIRST TO MAKE A HOLE AND THEN TO CLOSE IT
DEDUCTING FROM THIS TOTAL WHAT HAS BEEN CALCULATED AS THE PROPER NORMAL STOCK REQUISITE FOR A SUSTAINED YIELD MANAGEMENT THE BALANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR FELLING BUDGETS WHICH MAY BE UTILIZED IN ANNUAL OR PERIODIC INSTALMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF REGULATION
THE REACTION WHICH SET IN AGAINST THIS UNRESTRICTED USE OF FOREST PROPERTY RESULTED IN PRUSSIA NOT IN RENEWAL OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES BUT IN THE ENACTMENT OF PROMOTIVE ONES
THIS PROMOTIVE POLICY HAS ESPECIALLY SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE INSTITUTION IN MANY PROVINCES OF INFORMATION BUREAUS WHICH GIVE TECHNICAL ADVICE MAKE WORKING PLANS SECURE PLANT MATERIAL AND GIVE OTHER ASSISTANCE TO WOODLAND OWNERS
IT WAS THEN THAT THE DANGER OF A SHORTENING OF THE EXISTING ROTATIONS DUE TO THE APPARENT TRUTH THAT LONG ROTATIONS WERE UNPROFITABLE CALLED FOR A DIVISION INTO THE TWO CAMPS ALLUDED TO
SOME OF THE JOURNALS FOUNDED IN EARLIER TIMES HAVE CONTINUED WITH CHANGES IN TITLE AND EDITORSHIPS TO THE PRESENT DAY
WITH THE UNEXPECTED ELECTION OF RUDOLPH OF HAPSBURG A LITTLE KNOWN PRINCE OF SMALL POSSESSIONS TO THE DIGNITY OF GERMAN EMPEROR IN TWELVE SEVENTY TWO THE FOUNDATION OF THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE WAS LAID
REFORESTATION WHICH HAS BAFFLED THE ECONOMIST AND FORESTER UNTIL THE PRESENT TIME
THIS SUPERVISION WAS EXERCISED BY THE POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION OFTEN WITHOUT TECHNICAL ADVISERS AND THE DIFFERENT PROVINCES HAD DEVELOPED THIS SERVICE VERY VARIABLY
IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THIS SERVICE CONSISTED OF FOURTEEN FOREST INSPECTORS FIFTY SIX FOREST COMMISSIONERS SIXTY THREE FOREST ADJUNCTS AND EIGHTY ASSISTANTS AND FOREST GUARDS
FORCIBLE REFORESTATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF COMPETENT FORESTERS IN THESE ARE OBLIGATORY
A SPECIAL FUND FOR THE WORK WAS CREATED TO WHICH THE INTERESTED PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE ASSISTED BY ANNUAL SUBVENTIONS FROM THE STATE
THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STATE HAVE AVERAGED FROM FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PROVINCES TWENTY TO FIFTY PERCENT THE INTERESTED PARTIES HAVING CONTRIBUTED THIRTY PERCENT OF THE ROUND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EXPENDED ON THIS WORK BY NINETEEN O ONE
PROPERTY CONDITIONS BEING ENTIRELY UNCLEAR WHEN THE AUSTRIANS ASSUMED THE ADMINISTRATION THESE QUESTIONS HAD FIRST TO BE SETTLED BY A SURVEY
MOST OF THE STATE PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN THE ALPS AND CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS AT AN ELEVATION ABOVE TWO THOUSAND FEET HENCE FINANCIAL RESULTS DO NOT MAKE A GOOD SHOWING
THE NECESSITY FOR CONSERVATIVE FOREST USE AND REFORESTATION DID NOT ARISE AS EARLY IN AUSTRIA AS IT DID IN GERMANY
IN BOHEMIA THE CLEARING SYSTEM WITH ARTIFICIAL REFORESTATION MOSTLY BY SEED HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY FOR THE CONIFER FORESTS PLANTING AS A RULE BEING RESORTED TO ONLY IN FAIL PLACES
THROUGH RECKLESS CUTTING BURNING AND PASTURING BY THE SMALL FARMERS IT HAD BECOME ALMOST ENTIRELY DENUDED NATURAL REFORESTATION BEING PREVENTED BY THESE PRACTICES COMBINED WITH THE DRYNESS OF THE SOIL INTENSIFIED BY THE DEFORESTATION
HERE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE THE PASTURING OF GOATS WAS FORBIDDEN ON AREAS OF OVER ONE MILLION ACRES IN EXTENT WHICH WERE FOUND CAPABLE OF REFORESTATION
AS A RESULT OF THESE MEASURES NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES HAVE BEEN RECUPERATED
TO PROMOTE FOREST PLANTING SEVERAL NURSERIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT FROM WHICH AROUND TEN MILLION PLANTS ARE ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FREE OF CHARGE AND SUBVENTIONS FOR REFORESTATION OF WASTES ARE ALSO GRANTED ANNUALLY
BY EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO THE TOTAL PLANTATIONS AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES AND BY EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES HAD BEEN REFORESTED AND PARTS OF THE PLANTATIONS HAD BEGUN TO YIELD PROFITS
IN NINETEEN O FOUR THE COURSE WHICH WAS THREE YEARS AND ONLY OPTIONALLY FOUR ONE YEAR FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION WAS MADE FOUR YEARS FOR ALL AND IS OBLIGATORY FOR ALL HIGHER GRADE STATE OFFICIALS
TOPOGRAPHIC AND SOIL CONDITIONS NECESSARILY HAD ALSO THEIR INFLUENCE ON THIS DEVELOPMENT
AT THE SAME TIME AN ANNUAL VOTE OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS MADE TO THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION FOR REFORESTATION AND ENGINEERING WORKS IN THE ALPS
AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE COLLECTIONS WERE APPROPRIATED FOR REFORESTATION
UNTIL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR EACH CANTON HELD ITS OWN EXAMINATIONS FOR FOREST OFFICIALS BUT IN THAT YEAR A STANDARD WAS ENACTED FOR EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE FEDERALLY SUPERVISED TERRITORY
WHEREVER BY THE REFORESTATION OF BARE GROUND PROTECTIVE FOREST AREAS CAN BE CREATED THIS MAY BE ORDERED THE FEDERAL OR THE CANTONAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS SUCH WORK
OR ELSE IF THE OWNER PREFERS HE MAY INSIST UPON HAVING HIS GROUND EXPROPRIATED BY THE CANTON OR OTHER PUBLIC CORPORATION
THREE PROFESSORS OF FORESTRY BESIDES THE FACULTY OF THE INSTITUTION IN FUNDAMENTAL AND ACCESSORY BRANCHES ARE ACTIVE HERE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AVERAGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY FIVE
SIX OF AN ACRE PER CAPITA
AND THE ALIENABLE NATIONAL DOMAIN INCLUDING THE FOREST AND OTHER PROPERTY DERIVED FROM ROYAL OR CROWN DOMAINS
THERE ARE HOWEVER VOICES WHICH PROCLAIM THAT THE SUPERVISION BY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT AS THOROUGH AS IT SHOULD BE AND THAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE COMMUNAL PROPERTY HAVE DETERIORATED
FOUR WORK OF REFORESTATION
IT SEEMS THAT THE LAND OCCUPIED BY DUNES WAS ORIGINALLY FORESTED AND THAT THESE WERE CREATED BY DEFORESTATION
THE SUCCESS OF THIS PLANTATION INVITED IMITATORS AND BY EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE THE REFORESTED AREA HAD GROWN TO FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES
THIS LED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN TO THE PASSAGE OF A LAW ORDERING FORESTATION OF THE PARTS OF THE LAND OWNED BY THE STATE AS WELL AS BY THE COMMUNITIES THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME UNDERTAKING THE EXPENSE OF BUILDING A SYSTEM OF ROADS AND MAKING THE PLANS FOR FORESTATION FREE OF CHARGE
FIRST IN A SMALL WAY GAINING STRENGTH BY EIGHTEEN THIRTY AFTER SOME SPORADIC EXPERIMENTS HAD SHOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF REFORESTATION AND TO DAY OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF CONIFEROUS FOREST MAINLY AUSTRIAN AND SCOTCH PINE LARGELY PLANTED BY PRIVATE INCENTIVE ARE IN EXISTENCE THE BETTER ACRES BEING FARMED
REPEATED REPLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER OFFICIALS HAD NO MORE EFFECT THAN THE ISSUANCE OF ORDINANCES
THE SEED TREES LEFT ON THE FELLING AREAS GREW INTO UNDESIRABLE AND BRANCHY
THE GOVERNMENT VESTED IN THE OWNERS OR IRONWORKS THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITH CHARCOAL FROM STATE FORESTS
NOT TILL SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT DO WE AGAIN FIND AN ATTEMPT AT FOREST CONSERVANCY THIS TIME IN THE INTEREST OF SUPPLY OF CHARCOAL FOR THE IRON INDUSTRY BY THE APPOINTMENT OF OVERSEERS OF THE PUBLIC FORESTS
ON THE OTHER HAND ENCOURAGEMENT OF REFORESTATION WAS SOUGHT BY GIVING BOUNTIES FOR PLANTING WASTE LAND AND FOR LEAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SEED TREES IN THE FELLING AREAS ALSO BY PAYING REWARDS FOR THE BEST PLANTATIONS
DUE TO HER INSULAR POSITION WITH WHICH IN PART THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER NAVAL SUPREMACY IS CONNECTED ENGLAND CAN READILY SUPPLY HER NEEDS BY IMPORTATIONS
NOTABLY IN SCOTLAND EXTENSIVE HEATHS AND MOORS OF MANY HUNDRED SQUARE MILES IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND THE GRAMPIAN MOUNTAINS
THE TOTAL WOOD CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA IS BETWEEN TWELVE AND FOURTEEN CUBIC FEET HALF OF WHAT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO
MOST OF THESE PLANTINGS HAVE BEEN FOR PARK AND GAME PURPOSES
WELL FRANCESCO WHAT NEWS GOOD NEWS MY MOTHER
OH IT WILL BE A FINE DAY FOR US CRIED FRANCESCO
IN FACT THESE TWO SOVEREIGNS ON WHOM HISTORY HAS BESTOWED THE NAME OF CATHOLIC HAD RECONQUERED IN SUCCESSION NEARLY ALL SPAIN AND DRIVEN THE MOORS OUT OF GRANADA THEIR LAST ENTRENCHMENT
BUT HE FOUND THERE HIS BROTHER FRANCESCO
STILL AS THEIR TASTES WERE VERY DIFFERENT HATRED WITH FRANCESCO WAS ONLY THE FEAR OF THE DEER FOR THE HUNTER
BUT HIS HATRED FOR FRANCESCO GREW STRONGER FOR FROM HENCEFORTH HE WAS DOUBLY HIS RIVAL BOTH IN LOVE AND AMBITION
THE WEDDING OF THE TWO BASTARDS WAS MOST SPLENDID RICH WITH THE DOUBLE POMP OF CHURCH AND KING
THE TWO REGENTS COULD DO NO LESS THAN OBEY THE INVITATION WHICH WAS REALLY A COMMAND
HE WENT HOME AND WROTE TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW PAOLO ORSINI TO COME AND HELP HIM WITH HIS GENDARMES
THE ORSINI HAD SUBMITTED
SO INCLINED FROM THIS MOMENT TO YIELD TO THE KING OF FRANCE ANYTHING HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO ASK HE TOOK HIM BY HIS LEFT HAND AND MADE HIM A SHORT AND FRIENDLY REPLY DUBBING HIM THE CHURCH'S ELDEST SON
SO THEY CAME AND BROKE IN THE DOORS AS THOUGH THEY WERE TAKING ROME BY STORM AND WHILE CARDINAL VALENTINO WAS MAKING HOLIDAY WITH THEIR MASTER THEY PILLAGED HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE LOADING HER WITH INSULTS AND OUTRAGES WHICH NO TURKS OR SARACENS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IMPROVED UPON
BUT ANY EXPENSES THEY SHOULD INCUR LATER ON WERE TO BE DEFRAYED BY ALL IN EQUAL SHARES
HE KNEW THAT HE AND THE ORSINI TOGETHER WERE TOO WEAK TO SUSTAIN A WAR OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
FROM THIS MOMENT CARDINAL VALENTINO DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THE FATE OF THIS MAN THIS CONSTANT OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF HIS PRIDE HIS LOVE AND HIS AMBITION
THE TWO SERVANTS UNTIED A PACKET AND STRIPPING THE PRISONER OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL GARMENTS THEY RECLOTHED HIM IN A DRESS OF COARSE WHITE CLOTH WHICH ONLY REACHED DOWN TO HIS KNEES BREECHES OF THE SAME AND A PAIR OF CLUMSY SHOES
THE CARDINALS DEFERRING TO CAESAR'S WISHES GAVE A UNANIMOUS VOTE AND THE POPE AS WE MAY SUPPOSE LIKE A GOOD FATHER NOT WISHING TO FORCE HIS SON'S INCLINATIONS ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION AND YIELDED TO THE PETITION
AND LASTLY THE SUBSTITUTION OF POPULAR ELECTIONS FOR DRAWING BY LOT AND FOR OLIGARCHICAL NOMINATIONS
LONG LIVE THE ORSINI
THAT EVENING THE GUESTS MET AGAIN AND SPENT HALF THE NIGHT IN DANCING WHILE A MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY OF FIREWORKS LIGHTED UP THE PIAZZA OF SAN PAOLO
THEN THE ORSINI SEEING HIS ARMY THUS REDUCED ENTERED ROME SUPPORTED BY THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR AND SUMMONED CAESAR TO APPEAR BEFORE THE POPE AND THE SACRED COLLEGE AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS CRIMES
THE POPE ADMITTED THE JUSTICE OF THEIR CLAIMS AND ORDERED FRANCESCO TO ALLOW EACH OF THEM TWO THOUSAND CROWNS A YEAR
AS FOR FRANCESCO HE ESCAPED AS ON THE TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS BY THE PAYMENT OF A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
FRANCESCO DRIVEN NEARLY FRANTIC WITH RAGE WHEN HE SAW THIS VICTIM RELEASED FROM HIS CLUTCHES
TO MAKE SURE OF HER CUSTODY FRANCESCO KEPT HER SHUT UP IN A REMOTE APARTMENT OF HIS PALACE THE KEY OF WHICH HE KEPT IN HIS OWN POSSESSION
YET FRANCESCO TO ACCOMPLISH HIS DIABOLICAL PURPOSE EMPLOYED ALL THE MEANS AT HIS COMMAND
AT THIS TIME FRANCESCO WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE A JOURNEY AND LEAVE THE WOMEN ALONE AND FREE
AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS DURING WHICH NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE WAS FRANCESCO RETURNED
THE WRATH OF FRANCESCO FELL UPON HIS WIFE WHOM HE ACCUSED OF BETRAYING HIM
YET HE WAS RUDELY DISMISSED BY FRANCESCO
AT LENGTH FRANCESCO LOSING PATIENCE TOLD THIS OBSTINATE LOVER THAT A REASON EXISTED WHY BEATRICE COULD BE NEITHER HIS WIFE NOR ANY OTHER MAN'S
FRANCESCO REPLIED BECAUSE SHE IS MY MISTRESS
HENCEFORTH THE DOOM OF FRANCESCO WAS IRREVOCABLY PRONOUNCED
AND STIMULATING EACH OTHER'S DESIRE FOR REVENGE THEY DECIDED UPON THE MURDER OF FRANCESCO
WHILST ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE FOR THE DECAPITATION OF BEATRICE SEVERAL STANDS FULL OF SPECTATORS BROKE DOWN
HE MOST FIRMLY AND POTENTLY BELIEVED
AND THERE CON OVER OLD MATHER'S DIREFUL TALES
THE CHOLERIC VAN RIPPER
IT BEING ESTEEMED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS A POTENT NOURISHER AND STRENGTHENER OF THE HAIR
AND SMILING GRACIOUSLY IN REPLY TO ALL HIS AMOROUS OGLINGS
A MOST HERETICAL DISBELIEVER IN GHOSTS
THE SCHOOLMASTER NOW BESTOWED BOTH WHIP AND HEEL UPON THE STARVELING RIBS OF OLD GUNPOWDER
HANS VAN RIPPER
SHORTLY AFTER HIS RIVAL'S DISAPPEARANCE
IN QUEST OF SHELLS OR ENTOMOLOGICAL SPECIMENS
HE HAD FOUND AN UNKNOWN BIVALVE
YET I THOUGHT IT PRUDENT NOT TO EXACERBATE THE GROWING MOODINESS OF HIS TEMPER BY ANY COMMENT
WHAT NEW CROTCHET POSSESSED HIS EXCITABLE BRAIN
AND THE DOG HAVING BEEN UNMUZZLED
AS IF IN IMMEDIATE DREAD OF HIS MASTER'S ATTEMPT AT A GOUGE
IT WAS FOUND THAT WE HAD GREATLY UNDERVALUED THE TREASURE
SOME RELEVANCY
ALTHOUGH THE CRYPTOGRAPH IS BRIEF
AND TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT INTO THE RATIONALE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT
AND REINSTITUTED MY INQUIRIES AMONG THE OLDER NEGROES OF THE PLACE
WHILE HIS COADJUTORS WERE BUSY IN THE PIT
THERE WERE MANY DISCOLORATIONS ON THE CANVAS
TO THE HEAPS OF TAILINGS THAT ENCUMBERED IT
SERIOUSLY CONCERNED BY ONE OF THESE CROSSING SWEEPERS TURNING HASTILY BEFORE THEM AND BEING KNOCKED DOWN BY A PASSING CARRIAGE
AND THAT AT SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL CROSSINGS THE SWEEPERS WERE ALREADY RICH MEN
SPOKE GLOWINGLY OF HIS PARTNER'S BRILLIANT EXPECTATIONS
YES HE LAUGHED FORGIVINGLY
HEAVY CROSSING SWEEPER'S BROOM
ONE OF OUR JAMBOREES
WAS LUXURIATING IN AN EVENING PAPER
STILL POURING ITS UNRETURNING GOLD INTO THE SULKING SUN
ALL THE PETTY DRUDGERIES WHICH MUST BE DONE AND WHICH NO ONE WISHES TO DO
SHE CAME BACK FROM DEATH AS UNEMOTIONALLY AS SHE HAD GONE TO MEET IT
BAFFLED FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS SILENT WATCHING HER UNREVEALING FACE
AND HE COULD STRUM SOME SORT OF ACCOMPANIMENT ON THE PIANO TO ANY SONG
LATHERING HIS HANDS
I COULD SMELL THE OLD CARPETS AND THE HAIRCLOTH COVERING OF THE CHAIRS
HOW HER SOUL HAD RISEN ON THE CHORDS WHICH SHE STRUCK FOR THE DOXOLOGY
AND WE SET ABOUT THE CIRCUMVENTION OF THE SCUTTLE BY FAIR MEASURE OR FOUL
ALTHOUGH I KNOW OF THE CAPTURE OF AN OCTOPUS OF THE SEAS ABOUT VANCOUVER ISLAND
AND THAT IS HOW THE OCTOPUS CAME TO THE AQUARIUM
MIGHTY POWER BACK OF STAN AMERICA OIL CORPORATION
MUSCULAR BODY ABOVE A TORSION MACHINE HE WAS ADJUSTING
WELL HE MIGHT BE TERMED A MASTER GEO METALLURGIST
HAVE YOU EVER MET LEE WONG
OR HIS RUSSIAN GEOLOGICAL COLLABORATOR
AS NEON GASES CARRY AN ELECTRIC SPARK
I CAN CAUSE THE CHARGE TO KNOCK DOWN AND MERELY ELECTROCUTE
TELL ME HE TOOK A STEP TOWARD LEE WONG
AND NOT A FIGMENT OF HIS DISORDERED BRAIN
STAND WHERE YOU ARE LEE WONG SNAPPED
I'M NOT TRAPPED NO LEE WONG WRINKLED HIS FOREHEAD QUIZZICALLY
LEE WONG BOWED LOW AGAIN MOTIONING ASHER TO GO AHEAD
PROTECTING OUR UNDERGROUND WEALTH LEE WONG ANSWERED HIM
WHAT IT WILL MEAN THERE WAS A FANATICAL LIGHT IN LEE WONG'S BEADY EYES
A WORLD STRIPPED OF AUTOMOTIVE AND MECHANICAL POWER
HE TOOK A STEP TOWARD LEE WONG
HIS LEFT HAND CLOSED AROUND LEE WONG'S WRIST AS THE ORIENTAL TRIED TO PULL AWAY
HE JERKED LEE WONG'S ARM DOWN HEAVED AND CAME TO HIS FEET
LEE WONG WAS NO MORE
GOD HE HEARD THE RUSSIAN'S HIGH PITCHED VOICE
AS THEY BEGAN TO BREAK OFF THE HASPS OF THE LOCK WHICH HELD THE DOOR OF THE STOREHOUSE
AND THESE THEY WOLFED HUNGRILY
SO LIKE THE CROAK OF BULLFROGS BUT MAGNIFIED A THOUSAND TIMES
PERNICIOUS ANEMIA WOULD SET IN
THEY WERE BURNED TO CRISPS BY THE TROPIC SUN
IT BELONGED TO LORD HILTON'S BROTHER
THE POEM IS CALLED PSYCHE'S SORROW
FEARING HOPING EVERY SOUND SHE HEARKENS
BOUND FAST BOUND ARE PSYCHE'S AIRY PINIONS
AT REMAINING IN LORD HILTON'S HOUSE
BUT ALTHOUGH I LOVED LADY ALICE WITH MORE ENTIRENESS THAN EVEN DURING THE LATEST PERIOD OF OUR INTERCOURSE
THAT THE BELIEF IN HER SUPERNATURAL POWERS HAD ONLY HEIGHTENED THE NOTION OF HER VENERABLENESS
AND ALL WHO WERE ABLE HAD DESERTED THE CITY FOR SPOTS OF LESSER TORRIDITY
AND WE'LL GET YOUR OLD BONDS TO FRISCO
BUT I THOUGHT THIS ROCKET BUSINESS WAS NOT FEASIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE WASTAGE OF FUEL DUE TO ITS LOW EFFICIENCY I OBJECTED
AND I AM NOW WORKING ON A METHOD OF NEUTRALIZING IT
AND OUR BODIES WERE PRACTICALLY WEIGHTLESS WITH REFERENCE TO THE PIONEER
VISION FLASHES SHOWED IMMENSE GATHERINGS AT THE LARGE AIRPORTS AND IN THE PUBLIC SQUARES OF THE GREAT CITIES
THOUGH THEORIES AS TO THE ACTION AND SOURCE OF THE RAYS CONFLICTED GREATLY AND FORMED THE BASIS OF MUCH HEATED DISCUSSION
HERE HE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY THAT COMMANDED THE OFFICIAL'S ATTENTION AND RESPECT
I OBSERVED THAT THE PIONEER WAS ALREADY IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF DISASSEMBLY
HAD GONE TO THE PLAYROOM
TOO EASY IN FACT FOR WE WERE PRACTICALLY WEIGHTLESS
THE SUPPORTS TO WHICH WE WERE STRAPPED AND WHICH SAVED US FROM BEING CRUSHED BY THE ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION
BEING SWIVELED AT TOP AND BOTTOM
THEY COULD SWING AROUND SO THAT DECELERATION AS WELL AS ACCELERATION WAS RELIEVED
THUS ALLOWING FOR THEIR OPERATION BY THE PILOT EITHER WHEN ACCELERATING OR DECELERATING
ORANGE TINTED LUMINESCENCE THAT GREW TO A SPHERE OF PROBABLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER
THEN WITH EQUAL VIOLENCE WE DECELERATED
AN OCCASIONAL DISCHARGE FROM ONE OF THE FORWARD ROCKET TUBES ASSISTED MATERIALLY IN THE DECELERATION
AND I THANKED HIM WORDLESSLY
AND WERE TAKEN TO THE GERMANTOWN HOSPITAL WITH HER WHEN THE WRECK VICTIMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THAT POINT
WHEN WE PASS IN THE STREET THE POOR DELUDED SOUL SUBDUES HER BUOYANCY
NO DOUBT HER MISTRESS OVERWORKS HER
IT MUST ENRAGE THE OTHER SERVANTS TO SEE HER DEPORTING HERSELF AS IF SHE WERE QUITE THE LADY
HERE IT MINCES IN THE FASHION
SHE SNIFFED AND WAS RAISING AN UNTENDER HAND WHEN I CHECKED HER
ACCUSES YOU OF FIBBING AND CORRUPTING YOUTHFUL MINDS
FARTHER UP THE WALK IS THE LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE IN WHICH MARMADUKE PERRY HID
THERE IS NO MORE AWFUL STORY OF THE GARDENS BY DAY THAN THIS OF MARMADUKE PERRY
FROM THIS WALK A PASSAGE CALLED BUNTING'S THUMB
AND VERY ITCHY AT THE SHOULDERS
HE SPREADS OUT HIS FEATHERS AND PECKS THEM DRY
THE FAIRIES HAVE THEIR TIFFS WITH THE BIRDS
A MILKMAID TURNED HER PAIL UPSIDE DOWN AND HID IN IT
QUICKSILVER'S CAP SPREAD ITS WINGS
PERSEUS NOW UNDERSTOOD QUICKSILVER'S MOTIVE FOR SO EARNESTLY EXHORTING HIM TO POLISH HIS SHIELD
SEEMED TO FEEL MEDUSA'S DREAM
STILL KEEPING HIS EYES ON MEDUSA'S FACE
GREW ALL AT ONCE LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN MEDUSA'S HEAD
AND THE THUMP OF MEDUSA'S HEAD AS IT TUMBLED UPON THE SEA BEATEN SAND
BY OUTDOING ALL THEIR ANTICS
BESIDE QUICKSILVER'S CHAIR
AND MADE A GESTURE AS IF POURING MILK INTO QUICKSILVER'S BOWL
SO SHE HAD TO RESORT TO RAMMING
AS HE DREW CLOSE TO THE CANAL'S EDGE
SO CLOSELY WRAPPED IN A BLUE BLANKET CAPOTE THAT ONLY A PORTION OF HIS FACE SHOWED ITSELF
SEEMED DANK AND HEAVY LIKE A DUNGEON'S
THIS ABOMINABLE STORM NEARLY SUFFOCATES ME
MISTER MAYNARD'S KEEN EYES CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A DARK MASS RISING DIMLY INTO THE AIR A LITTLE MORE THAN A MILE AWAY
HIS QUICKNESS AND STEADINESS ENTITLING HIM TO THAT IMPORTANT POSITION
BUT FOR THE PLUCKY GOALKEEPER PUTTING HIS BROAD CHEST SQUARELY IN THE WAY
FRANK BROOKFIELD AND JACK STONE WERE VERY GREAT FRIENDS
THE SIGHT OF HIS PLAYMATE'S PERIL NERVED HIM TO FRESH EXERTIONS
FOUR THE ESTATE OF THE DEAD MAN WAS SMALL AND UNCOMPLICATED
WHEN SHE LEFT THE ROOM HE WENT INTO THE LABORATORY AND TOOK HIS WATCH OFF THE SKELETON'S FINGERS
THE WOMEN WHO UNDERSTOOD AND THE USUAL PACK OF JOLLY DANCING GIRLS AND FLAPPERS
UNRECORDED IN ANY WORD OR THOUGHT HIS BRAIN COULD COMPASS
HE TURNED SWIFTLY AND SKATED OVER TO THE LITTLE ENTRANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND PRESENTLY WHEN HE SKATED WITH HER
AND HE SKATED QUICKLY TO THE SHED
TO HAVE SKATED WITH A GIRL ALONE AT MIDNIGHT
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SKATED ON THE LITTLE RINK
YET NOWHERE AMONG THE OTHERS DID HE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THAT SLIM YOUNG CREATURE HE HAD SKATED WITH ALONE BENEATH THE CLOUDED STARS
PERHAPS IT WAS THE WISH THAT FATHERED IT ONLY
PEOPLE WERE ALREADY ARRIVING FROM THE OTHER HOTELS AND CHALETS
GROUPS LEFT ONE BY ONE GOING HOME TO THEIR HOTELS AND CHALETS
THAT OTHER POWER WHICH DOES NOT EXHILARATE BUT DEADENS EFFORT
HER HAIR PASSED BLINDINGLY ACROSS HIS EYES
CALVIN GREER CALLED HIM UP ON THE TELEPHONE THAT EVENING
HIS COWS UNMILKED AND HIS HORSES WITH EMPTY MANGERS
AND THEY LIGHTENED THE TEDIUM OF THE WALK BY GUYING THE POMPOUS POLICE CHIEF IN A WAY THAT REDUCED HIM TO SULLEN HOMICIDAL YEARNINGS
BUT NO CHALLENGE BARK CHECKED BUFF'S OBSESSED FLIGHT
NOTED HIS TENSE POSE AND THE ARROW LIKE STRAIGHTNESS OF HIS COURSE AND RAISED THE SHOUT OF
AND THAT A GENUINELY HYDROPHOBIC DOG IS NO MORE IN CONDITION TO CHASE AND ATTACK PEOPLE THAN IS A TYPHOID PATIENT
BUT IN BUFF'S CASE THE SHOUT WAS RAISED TOO LATE
BUFF'S TEETH CLOSED ON THE BULLDOG'S RIGHT FORELEG
INSTEAD THEY BURIED THEMSELVES IN BUFF'S UPPER RIGHT FORELEG
EMITTING A MOST HORRENDOUS YELL OF PAIN AND RAGE
BUFF'S GRINDING JAWS HAD FOUND THE JUGULAR
A RANGE THAT SPLITS NORTH JERSEY'S FARM COUNTRY FOR SOME TWENTY ODD MILES
ROUNDING UP THE HORDE OF MONGRELS
AND HE COULD NOT FORGET THE WILY BLACK GIANT THAT HAD LED THE BAND OF MONGRELS
ALSO HE WAS TAM'S DEAREST FRIEND
WHEN A STRAY CUR MISUNDERSTOOD WISP'S GAY FRIENDLINESS AND SHOWED HIS TEETH AT THE FRAIL LITTLE DOG
HE WAS WISP'S GUARDIAN AS WELL AS HIS DEAREST COMRADE
ONCE IN A VERY GREAT WHILE SUCH INSEPARABLE FRIENDSHIPS SPRING UP BETWEEN TWO COLLIES
FOR HIS WIFE WAS ADVANCING SLOWLY AND SPIRITLESSLY
HE MUTTERED WORRIEDLY TO TAM
FOR WISP'S LOST BODY
WITH WISP'S TRAIL WAS MINGLED THAT OF TWO OF THE CHILDREN
THE SPATTERS OF DRIED BLOOD
BUT ONCE MORE TAM DID NOT FOLLOW HIS OVERLORD'S BIDDING
SAID HIS WIFE WORRIEDLY
POINTING PRESENTLY TO A GAP IN THE PRIVET HEDGE WHICH SHUT OFF THE BARNS FROM THE TRUCK GARDEN
THOSE ARE TAM'S FOOTPRINTS I ADMIT THAT
MEN SAW TAM PROWLING ALONG THE MONGREL'S COOLING TRACKS
AND HIS JAWS HAD FOUND A HOLD ABOVE TAM'S JUGULAR
THRICE MORE THE BLACK STRUCK FOR THE JUGULAR
ONE OF TAM'S FORELEGS WAS BLEEDING FREELY
FAR UP ON TAM'S LEFT FORELEG
FROM HIS CONQUEROR'S JAWS
A SECOND WAS NOW DESPATCHED TO THE HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE RICHARD AND THE YOUNG PRINCE ALBERTO
MINE THE BEING MUTTERED A NEW HOARSENESS IN HIS VOICE
HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF PAT'S TRAGIC EYES
PEROXIDE'S GONE FLAT HE GROWLED
I'M A QUESTION OF SYNAPSES
EVERY PSYCHIATRIST USES HYPNOTISM IN HIS BUSINESS
AND RUMPLE UP YOUR BED
CANCERS AND TUMORS SARCOMAS ARE CURIOUS THINGS DEAR
IT WAS A LITTLE CEREBRUM
THE NERVES FROM THE TWO RIVAL BRAINS MUST HAVE MET IN A SYNAPTIC JUNCTURE
I MADE THE MISTAKE OF DRUGGING THE NORMAL BRAIN AND GIVING THE OTHER COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE BODY
THAT NICK'S CHARACTER WILL BE CHANGED NOW I THINK SO
DON'T FORGET TO SLIP IN UNSEEN PAT AND RUMPLE UP YOUR BED
RUMPLE IT SHE GAVE HIM A WEARY SMILE
EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN HAS HIS OR HER ASSIGNMENTS IN THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DAILY LIFE
YET IN HIS MARBLE PALACE WILL RISE UNFORBIDDEN THE VISION OF HIS CHILDHOOD'S HOME
TO THE EXILE'S FOND FANCY IT CLOTHES THE NAKED ROCK
LIKE THAT GROWING OUT OF THE DISPOSITION WHICH CONSECRATES OR DESECRATES A HOME
DISPLACING UNSUITABILITY
WOMAN IS THE CONSERVATOR OF MORALITY AND RELIGION
TEND TO ENERGIZE HIS INTELLECT
THUS A WIFE MAY BE THE MAKING OR UNMAKING OF THE BEST OF MEN
BUT THESE GRUMBLERS WERE ONLY A FEW WE MUST THINK
GRITTING HIS TEETH NOW AND THEN AS THE PAIN BITES
FIVE RIGHT HONORABLES
AND THUS THE WHOLE FORMS A SORT OF SMALL TILTED WAGON WITH A WELTED FRAME
AND THERE THEY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A REGULAR MILITARY COMPANY CALLED THE ASSOCIATED LOYALISTS
FOR WHEN THE HESSIANS HAD ATTACKED THE TOWN
BUT WHEN THE HESSIANS LEFT
I TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE LIABLE TO MISCONSTRUCTION
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT HESSIANS
DO WE LOOK LIKE HESSIANS ASKED ONE OF THEM RUDELY
TOLD TWO OF THE MIDSHIPMEN
AND FILLED THE ALMOST HOPELESS DERELICTS WITH A NEW TERROR
THEY PASSED WHAT THE CAPTAIN SUPPOSED MUST BE THE FIJI ISLANDS
EXPECTED EVERY MINUTE TO HEAR THE ROAR OF THE BREACHING BATTERIES
SEVERAL BOOBIES FLYING VERY NEAR TO US
OUR TURTLING PARTY HAD NO SUCCESS
MADE PITCAIRN'S ISLAND
AND REVEALED BY THE ENGLISHMEN'S WIVES
TOUCHED AT PITCAIRN'S ISLAND
AND THAT ON THE WHOLE THEIR MISTAKES ARE NOT PROPORTIONALLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF HUMAN BUILDERS
WHEN YOU MEET SUCH A DAM ON THE STREAM YOU ARE CANOEING DON'T ATTEMPT TO BREAK THROUGH
BECAUSE A DEN UNDER A CEDAR'S ROOTS IS AS SAFE AND WARM
HE FINDS TENDER TWIGS MUCH JUICIER
WHEN I REACHED THE JUNIPERS THE CROWS
AND PRISONERS' BASE
I KNOW HOW TO BE ABASED AND HOW TO ABOUND HE SAYS
AND THEN COMMANDED A STRICT AND RIGID INWARDNESS AND SPIRITUALITY
AND BY MERE HUMAN RELIANCES
THAT CONFIDES IN HIS LOVE
THE THOUSAND MINUTE CARES AND PERPLEXITIES OF LIFE BECOME EACH ONE A FINE AFFILIATING BOND BETWEEN THE SOUL AND ITS GOD
IT IS HARD FOR HIM TO KEEP FOREFATHERS' DAY
AND ALL MANNER OF DELICIOUSNESS
AS IF THE SUN HAD DONE HIS BEST TO FERTILISE THE SOIL
IT IS A COSMICAL PHENOMENON REPLIED THE DOCTOR
FOR ALL THE MERIDIANS BLENDED A FEW HUNDRED FEET HIGHER
HE KNEW THAT LESTER'S MEN
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION JIM HURLEY WAS HERE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
HAPPY'S CHIEF JOY IN LIFE IS TALKING
YOU KNOW HOW FINICKY HE IS ABOUT HIS CLOTHES
A COMPLAINER IS NOT THE KIND OF MAN WHO CAN DESTROY THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA
AS A QUICK REPAIRER OF DAMAGED GARMENTS
YOU NEEDN'T BE SO PREACHY
AND IT INTIMATED IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE THAT BRAGG'S ARMY WAS GOING TO STRIKE A GREAT BLOW
AND OF COURSE THE YANKEE BLOCKADING SHIPS WILL BE READY FOR THEM
BUT HARRY HAD RECOVERED HIS STRENGTH AND HE WAS ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT DALTON'S ASSISTANCE
BUT HE ALWAYS OVERRATES THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY
HE ALWAYS OVERESTIMATES THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY
THERE WAS SOMETHING HUMOROUS IN THE EXPLOITS OF THE MAN WHO HELD UP GENERAL EARLY'S MESSENGERS
PROBABLY SOME OLD FRENCH AIR OR A GREAT LYRIC OUTBURST OF THE FIERY VERDI
I WISH NOT TO OBTRUDE ANY CONSTRAINTS OR RESTRAINTS UPON YOU
STAFFS OF SIGNALMEN
THE FISH IN HIS CREEL HAD GROWN PERCEPTIBLY HEAVIER
HIS CREEL BESIDE HER
BRINGING BACK EACH TIME ARMLOADS OF BOUGHS AND TWIGS
CRESS AND DANDELION SALAD
HE LAUGHED AMUSEDLY
ALTOGETHER SHE HAD DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE PURELY ORNAMENTAL CHARACTER OF THE LANDSCAPE
SHE OPENED HER CREEL AND SHOWED HIM
AND OVER THE OPENING TOWARD THE FIRE WAS A PROJECTING EAVE WHICH COULD BE LOWERED OVER ONE SIDE AS A PROTECTION FROM THE WIND
THE BATHER CLAMBERED UP THE BANK INTO THE SUNLIGHT CHILLED TO THE BONE
SHE HUNG THE CREEL IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE AND RESUMED HER SEAT BY THE FIRE
AND THE RISING SUN WAS BURNISHING THEM
I'M RIGHT AS A TRIVET
HIS EYES STILL GLOWING UNFAMILIARLY SOUGHT ONLY HERS
NEW OR REFURBISHED
COLONEL BROADHURST TOOK UP THE GLASS WHICH PERCY ENDICOTT HAD ORDERED AND REGARDED IT PONDEROUSLY
SAID COLONEL BROADHURST WITH ANOTHER SIGH
A NEW YORKER AND A CLINKER
HAD HE NOT HIMSELF IN TIMES PAST ASSISTED AT THE POST MORTEMS OF DEAD REPUTATIONS
NO FRIPPERIES COULD CONCEAL THEM
SHE INTERRUPTED COLDLY STRONGLY ACCENTING THE WORD
BESIDE HIM ON THE DRIVE GAY TURNOUTS HURRIED
BUT NO ONE OF HIS BLOOD HAD EVER BROOKED CONTEMPT
SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE FORGIVEN HIM THE PHYSICAL CONTACT THAT HAD DEFAMED HER WOMANHOOD
EACH OF THEM FURNISHED WITH A LIGHT REFLECTOR
BEFORE ONE DISCOVERED THE OWNER OF THIS ROOM ONE WOULD HAVE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT HE MUST BE SMALLISH
PERCY ENDICOTT SAYS
ALWAYS TOO D STARCHY FOR ME ANYWAY
THEN HE EXAMINED WORTHINGTON'S FACE
CONSCIOUS THAT HER COMPANION'S INTRUSIVENESS AND BRUTALITY WERE DRAGGING HER PRIDE IN THE DUST
BUT HIS KEEN EYES SAW THAT HER FACE WAS BLANCHING AND HER EMOTION INFURIATED HIM
SLIPPING HER SMALL FEET INTO FUR LINED ROOM SLIPPERS AND PUTTING ON A FLOWERED KIMONO
SHE SAID TEPIDLY POLITE AND THEN QUICKLY TO HER HOSTESS
AND WHILE HE TALKED AMUSEDLY
IT WAS THE CUSTOM AT RICHARD PENNINGTON'S DINNERS FOR THE MEN TO FOLLOW THE LADIES AT ONCE TO THE LIBRARY OR DRAWING ROOM IF THEY CARED TO
AND WHILE MISS TREMAINE CAUGHT THE SPIRIT OF THE THING IN A GAY CADENCE OF THE BOULEVARDS
INSTINCT WARNED HER THAT CURIOSITY HAD DRAWN HER TO THE VERGE OF INTRUSIVENESS
BUT HER HEART WAS THROBBING AND THE HANDS BENEATH THE WIDE SLEEVES OF HER OPERA KIMONO WERE NERVOUSLY CLUTCHED
BUT I'VE GOT THE HAT AND THE SMELLY PIPE
I'M A HOYDENISH HARD RIDING LOUD SPOKEN VIXEN AND THAT'S THE TRUTH
MOST OF US ARE FOREVER PURRING AND PAWING AND MY DEARING ONE ANOTHER WHEN WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO SPIT AND CLAW
PENNINGTON'S PRETTY SHOULDERS GAVE AN EXPRESSIVE SHRUG
FROM FORTUNE HUNTERS AND GENTLEMEN JOCKEYS
PENNINGTON'S LAUGH THREW DISCRETION TO THE WINDS
I WAS LOST ONCE IN THE ADIRONDACKS
JANE COLORED ADORABLY
PENNINGTON'S ADVICE
AND AN OSTEOPATH WAS BUSY MANIPULATING HER SMALL BODY
BUT SHE CHOSE THIS METHOD OF REHABILITATING HER TIRED NERVES INSTEAD OF ACTIVE EXERCISE WHICH SHE ABHORRED
I'LL STARE HIM DOWN UNTIL HE SLINKS AWAY
AND ACCESSION AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE TO ITS RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE SIGNAL FOR A CELEBRATION WITH AN INTENT BOTH GASTRONOMIC AND BIBULOUS
THE OTHER MORNING AT NELLIE PENNINGTON'S
THE MUSIC BEGAN AGAIN AND PERCY ENDICOTT AT THIS MOMENT CAME UP
JANE WAS IN ENDICOTT'S ARMS
SENT OUT FOR THE OCCASION FROM MISTER SAVAGE'S OWN COLLECTION IN TOWN
WHO LOOKED UP INTO WORTHINGTON'S FACE FOR A POSSIBLE MEANING OF THE INCIDENT
PENNINGTON'S PHILOSOPHY HAD TAUGHT HER THAT IT WAS BETTER TO BE SURPRISED THAN TO BE BORED
THOUGH UNCONFIRMED IN AUTHORITATIVE QUARTERS
ANOTHER MATTER WHICH CAUSED SOME INQUIETUDE WAS NELLIE PENNINGTON'S RETURN TO TOWN
AT THEIR FIRST MEETING JANE HAD CARRIED OFF THE SITUATION WITH A CARELESSNESS WHICH SHE FELT HAD RATHER OVERSHOT THE MARK
PENNINGTON'S ENTHUSIASTIC FELLOWSHIP
HE HAD ABASED HIMSELF ENOUGH AND FURTHER EFFORTS AT A RECONCILIATION COULD ONLY DEMEAN HIS DIGNITY
ALREADY JEOPARDIZED
HE SOUSED HIMSELF IN THE COLD WATER AND CAME OUT WITH CHATTERING TEETH
HIS EYES MORE PROTRUSIVE
OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE STALKER OF PREY HAS ALL THE ADVANTAGE
HE HAD WITNESSED THESE SPURTS OF INDUSTRY BEFORE AND REMEMBERED THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS PRESAGED THE BURSTING OF A BUBBLE AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE JUNIOR PARTNER FOR A PROTRACTED PERIOD
AND KENYON'S MOST PERSUASIVE STORIES FAILED TO FIND A RESPONSE
DETERMINED NOT TO BE OUTRIDDEN BY A WOMAN
SHE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST AND HE LOOKED AT HER AMUSEDLY
HE LIGHTED HIS PIPE AND STARTED DOWNSTAIRS TOWARD THE GUNROOM
YOU'VE TREATED MY ADVICE WITH THE SCANTEST CEREMONY
NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ARRANGED WHICH COULD CONSPIRE MORE THOROUGHLY TO LACERATE THE FEELINGS OF THOSE ASSEMBLED
IT WOULD DEMEAN HER TO DENY IT AS IT DEMEANS ME
AS OTHER THINGS HAVE DEMEANED YOU
TO SMIRCH THE GOOD NAME OF AN HONEST MAN
I'VE SHOWN HIM INTO MISTER KENYON'S OFFICE AS YOU DIRECTED
DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN PASSED FOR TWO YEARS AND THE VALUE OF THE STOCK HAS DEPRECIATED
SUCCINCTNESS AND DAMNABLE ACCURACY
THERE WON'T BE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN DISCREDITING HIS TESTIMONY
SHE MUTTERED STIFLINGLY
PENNINGTON'S VICTORIA
FOR THERE WAS A CASE OF THE TEA DUST GLAZES WHICH HE HAD STILL PLANNED TO LOOK OVER
PENNINGTON'S WAS A GREAT PLAN
PENNINGTON'S REQUEST
LADY HEATHCOTE HERSELF SHOWED SIGNS OF THE WEAR AND TEAR OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION
AND WHILE SHE LIVED IN LONDON'S INNERMOST CIRCLE
ELIMINATING ALL UNCERTAIN QUANTITIES THROUGH WHOM OR BY WHOM THE UNRESERVED CHARACTER OF THE CONVERSATION ACROSS HER BOARD MIGHT IN ANY WAY BE JEOPARDIZED
THE BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR IN LONDON'S FIRMAMENT OF ART
LONG A MEMBER OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S CIRCLE
ONE OF LONDON'S CATCHES
FOR DORIS MATHER'S BRAINS WERE ABOVE THE ORDINARY
HE HAD CONTRIBUTED LIBERALLY FROM HIS LARGE MEANS TO LADY HEATHCOTE'S AMBULANCE FUND
ONE OF THE SECRETS OF THE SUCCESS OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNERS WAS THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF HER TABLE
HE QUOTED VACUOUSLY AND WENT ON WITH HIS SOUP
FROM LADY HEATHCOTE
WHAT WE NEED IS FAST BOWLERS WITH RIFLES
COME LADY HEATHCOTE WON'T MIND OUR TOBACCO
SHE REPEATED SCATHINGLY
SAID BETTY HEATHCOTE
A REFLECTOR GLEAMED FROM ONE
WHILE ITS HEADLIGHT WHIRLED DRUNKENLY IN A WILD ORBIT OF TOSSED SHADOWS
THE SPORTSWOMAN IN HER RESPONDED TO THE CALL OF SPEED
FOUR PAGES WRITTEN LENGTHWAYS IN INK WITH A LINE TOO FINE ALMOST FOR LEGIBILITY
DORIS'S HEART STOPPED BEATING AS IN A FLASH OF REVIVING MEMORY THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE CAME QUICKLY BACK TO HER
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE PEAKY LATELY
SHE SENT A WIRE TO LADY HEATHCOTE AND THEN TOM SAW HER SAFELY INTO HER CARRIAGE
LADY HEATHCOTE RELAXED THE REINS SO THAT ONE OF HER LEADERS PLUNGED MADLY
SAID LADY HEATHCOTE
SAID LADY HEATHCOTE
ALL THREE HAD BEEN AT LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNER
SAID LADY HEATHCOTE BITTERLY
SAID LADY HEATHCOTE
UNLESS SOMETHING IS TAKEN I SHOULDN'T CARE TO DISTURB LADY HEATHCOTE
HERE WITHIN THE VERY DOORS OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S HOUSE
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GAZE THAT SEEMED TO PIERCE ALL HER SUBTERFUGES
BUT THE SPORTSWOMAN IN HER MADE HER KEEN TO PUT IT TO THE TEST
AND IF I TOLD LADY HEATHCOTE OF THIS
HE TOOK OFF HIS FUR COAT IN LEISURELY FASHION AND CROSSING TO THE FIREPLACE TOOK DORIS'S PROFFERED HAND
DORIS HAD HELPED CYRIL OFF WITH HIS COAT AND BY THE TIME THE MAID BROUGHT BETTY HEATHCOTE
SAID LADY HEATHCOTE
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF I HAD THE ROOM BETWEEN YOURS AND DORIS'S
LADY HEATHCOTE RANG FOR WILSON AND THEN RETIRED TO THE MINISTRATIONS OF HER OWN MAID
GATHERING UP SOME BRASSES ON LADY HEATHCOTE'S DESK
SHE SAID SCATHINGLY
BUT IT WAS HIS ABJECTNESS THAT HAD MADE HER SCORNFUL
ABJECTNESS WORN AS SHE NOW KNEW WITH AN OBJECT THAT WAS INDIFFERENT TO SCORN
THE ONE THING THAT NOW SEEMED TO PERSIST IN HER MIND WAS THE HOPE THAT WILSON HAD OBEYED ORDERS AND KEPT LADY HEATHCOTE IN IGNORANCE OF HER ABSENCE
WHO DID NOT LIVE WITHOUT A TERROR OF VON STROMBERG IN HIS HEART
LEAVING LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNER PARTY IN AN AUTOMOBILE
WHERE DID YOU PUT THIS COPY AFTER LEAVING LADY HEATHCOTE'S IN LONDON
AND SO YOU HAD ME CHLOROFORMED
SINCE THE NIGHT OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNER IN LONDON YOU CEASED TO BE MISS DORIS MATHER AND BECAME MERELY AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT
DO YOU THINK THAT MY FATHER THAT LADY HEATHCOTE
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON IN ENGLAND WHO JEOPARDIZED MY EXISTENCE THERE
SAID VON STROMBERG GRIMLY
IT WAS THE DAY OF AN ANNIVERSARY ALWAYS CELEBRATED FOR ME BY LADY HEATHCOTE
IT WAS THE EVENING OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNER
GENERAL VON STROMBERG TOOK A SMALL OBJECT FROM HIS POCKET AND WEIGHED IT LIGHTLY IN THE FINGERS OF ONE HAND
SAID VON STROMBERG WITH A WIDE WAVE OF THE HAND
AT LADY HEATHCOTE'S HOUSE IN SCOTLAND
IT WAS THE NIGHT OF LADY HEATHCOTE'S DINNER IN LONDON
DORIS MATHER'S VOICE WAS RAISED JUST A TRIFLE
REVEALING A PATCH OF UNFADED WALLPAPER
BUT VON STROMBERG STILL SMILED
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I CAN BE INCRIMINATED BY A CONFESSION MADE UNDER THE STRESS OF A TERROR ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCED
HE CLUNG TO THE THOUGHT OF LINDBERG'S FIDELITY AND AFFECTION AS A DYING MAN CLINGS TO THE HOPE OF HEAVEN
BUT LINDBERG SMILED AT HIM AND PLUCKING THE WEAPON OUT
HE SAW THAT THERE WERE TWO DORMERS
FOR WHILE ONE OF THE ROOMS WAS DORIS'S
AND WHEN CYRIL PUT HIS STRENGTH TO DORIS'S
HE STILL STOOD IN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHT
DIMPLING ADORABLY
BUT HE KNEW THAT HIS APPEARANCE ALONE COULD NOT HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE SUDDEN BLANCHING OF THE WOMAN'S FACE AND THE AIR OF ALARM WITH WHICH SHE REGARDED HIM
TOGGLED AT THE BOTTOM TO RINGS IN THE SILL
ONE AFTER ANOTHER QUICKLY UNFASTENED THE TOGGLES WHICH HELD IT IN PLACE
FOR DORIS'S EYES WERE STARING IN PANIC AT SOMETHING BEHIND HIM
THEY CLUTCHED AT THE TOGGLES AND SWUNG OFF THEIR FEET
BUT HOW CAN YOU AUTHENTICATE YOUR CLAIM TO THE PROPERTY
A NATTERING DISTINCTION WHICH HE SELDOM LAVISHED UPON HIS VISITORS
BUT ONE OF THOSE DAZZLING AND RADIANT BLONDES FOUND ONLY IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE SUN
FAILED TO THROW UPON HER GARDEN THREE OR FOUR BASKETFULS OF RICHER SOIL
THE FATE THAT OVERSHADOWS US WILL RUIN YOU ALSO
EVERYONE SPOKE OF THAT AS AN INCONTESTABLE AND UNCONTESTED FACT
BUT HE WATCHED ALL THAT WENT ON IN THE HOUSE WITH THAT SUBTLENESS OF PENETRATION WHICH FEVER SO OFTEN IMPARTS
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT ARE CONVINCED THAT MY HUSBAND COMMANDED THE INSURRECTIONISTS
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO IMPROVISE THERE
BUT HE DIVINED IT BY THE AID OF THAT STRANGE PRESCIENCE WHICH SO OFTEN ILLUMINATES THE MIND WHEN DEATH IS NEAR AT HAND
BY VILELY TRADUCING HIM
THE CIRCULAR CONVENING THE CONSPIRATORS
I SHALL BE VILIFIED IN THE JOURNALS
HE MUST NOT ALLOW THESE THOUGHTS TO UNNERVE HIM
AND THE VOICE OF THE CRIERS PROCLAIMING THIS INFAMOUS EDICT
SHE HAD NO TIME TO TEMPORIZE OR TO REFLECT
SHE MUST IMPROVISE FOR HERSELF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REPUTATION
TO THE WILD LONGING THAT SOMETIMES UNBINDS THE TONGUE OF THE WORST CRIMINALS
AND THERE WAS EVEN TALK OF SENDING TO PARIS FOR ONE OF THOSE DETECTIVES SKILLED IN UNRAVELLING ALL THE MYSTERIES OF CRIME
WE SHALL FINISH BY ENCASING THIS PRECIOUS AUNT IN COTTON SHALL WE NOT
TO THIS HOLLOW UNSATISFYING RESTLESS LIFE
THEY PREPARED ALL SORTS OF GRUELS AND BROTHS FOR HIM
CAPTAIN HOOPER'S EYES SPARKLED
THE INJURIES BELOW WATER WERE STOPPED FROM INBOARD
DIMMING THE MEMORIES OF YOUTHFUL IMPULSES AND MADNESSES
AND THE BOOK OF THE MARTYRS WAS BUT A PART OF SALVATION'S INSTRUCTION IN SIMPLE AND PIOUS THOUGHT
FOR FURTHER THAN SHOWING A CLOTH ABOUT HIS NECK AND A CERTAIN HUSKINESS IN THE VOICE HE GAVE NO SIGN OF ROUGH HANDLING
HE TOOK A SWIG FROM HIS POT AND RAISED HIS VOICE
WHEN I SAW TWO OTHERS WITH BLUDGEONS DANCING ABOUT AND AIMING AT MY HEAD
IT MEANT PRISON AT THE WORST AT THE BEST CAPTAIN HOOPER'S DISDAIN
HIS EYES SWIMMING AS HE GAZED AND HIS WHITE TEETH GLEAMING HATEFULLY THROUGH HIS BEARD
AND THE SALTINESS MADE ONE LONG THE MORE FOR FRESH WATER AND FOOD
YET SURE OF HIS PREY AND CHARMING BY HIS VENOMOUSNESS
UNBINDING MY FEET
HAD I DONE SO THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE INSULTED HER AND DEMEANED ME
WHEN THEY HAD UNCLOAKED HE HAD SAID TO HIS CAVALIER
FOR NOTHING HAD OCCURRED TO MAR OUR PLANS AND ALL THINGS NEEDFUL WERE READILY PROCURABLE
HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY WOULD SAIL THROUGH THE BAHAMA CHANNEL
AND SOFTLY ILLUMINED AS HE WAS BY THE PALE AND GHOSTLY TRANSLUCENCE OF THE NIGHT
THEY HAD NO WEAPONS AND HAD REMOVED THEIR DOUBLETS TO ROW THE BETTER
WITH AN INTAKING OF BREATH THAT RACKED HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT
HIS RIGIDNESS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE BROKE INTO A MERRY LAUGH
FROM EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE THROUGH NINETEEN TWENTY IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED STATES AVERAGED SOME FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND PERSONS PER YEAR
THE EARLIEST COLONISTS WERE PREDOMINANTLY BRITISH
WITH THE EXPANSION OF THIS FACTION'S SUPPORT AND INFLUENCE THERE WERE RECURRENT MANIFESTATIONS OF ANTI ALIEN FEELING
THIS COMMISSION SUBMITTED A VOLUMINOUS REPORT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN WHICH DISCUSSED THE DESIRABILITY OF LIMITING IMMIGRATION AND FAVORED A LITERACY TEST AS THE MOST FEASIBLE SINGLE METHOD OF RESTRICTING UNDESIRABLE IMMIGRATION
BILLS PRESCRIBING A LITERACY TEST FOR IMMIGRANTS WERE PASSED AT VARIOUS TIMES BY CONGRESS
A FOURTH BILL WAS VETOED BY PRESIDENT WILSON BUT HIS VETO WAS OVERRIDDEN BY CONGRESS IN ENACTING THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING THE LITERACY REQUIREMENT
THE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN ACT CODIFIED AND EXTENDED PREVIOUS RESTRICTIONS
THE COUNTRY TURNED ITS BACK ON PRESIDENT WILSON ON THE INTERNATIONALISTS AND ON THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
IDEOLOGICALLY
THE MORE EXTREME RATIONALE OF THIS DRAMATIC NATIONALIST REVIVAL WAS THE GOSPEL OF NORDIC WHITE SUPREMACY
UNEMPLOYMENT MOUNTED RAPIDLY
INCLUDING MANY ALLEGED UNDESIRABLES
BUT ON THE LITERACY TEST
WHAT STARTED OUT AS A DEBATE ON A LITERACY REQUIREMENT DEVELOPED INTO A MOVE TO END ALL IMMIGRATION
IT DOES ADD SOME IMPORTANT RACIST PROVISIONS WHICH
A PROVISION WHICH HAS GENERALLY BEEN REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE CARIBBEAN AREA
A DISCRIMINATORY LAW THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY MAJOR ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHICH HAS WRITTEN DISCRIMINATION INTO ITS NATIONAL IMMIGRATION LAWS
WITHOUT GIVING CREDENCE TO ANY THEORY OF NORDIC SUPERIORITY
BUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HOLDS THAT THE PEOPLES WHO HAD MADE THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COUNTRY WERE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN DETERMINING THAT THE COUNTRY WAS NO LONGER A FIELD FOR FURTHER COLONIZATION
FURTHER IMMIGRATION WOULD NOT ONLY BE RESTRICTED BUT DIRECTED TO ADMIT IMMIGRANTS CONSIDERED TO BE MORE READILY ASSIMILABLE BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND TO THOSE OF THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF OUR POPULATION
A SECOND INDICATION OF THE INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATORY CHARACTER OF THE ACT OF NINETEEN FIFTY TWO IS THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH THE LAW REPEALS THE JAPANESE EXCLUSION ACT AND SETS UP A MINIMUM QUOTA FOR JAPANESE
THESE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED WITHOUT PUBLIC HEARINGS
IN THE COMMISSION'S HEARINGS THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA THE SCIENTISTS
THE THEORY OF SUPERIOR RACES THE IMMIGRATION COMMISSION'S REPORT OF NINETEEN ELEVEN SOUGHT TO CLASSIFY RACES IN A PSEUDO SCIENTIFIC MANNER AS HAVING GROUP AND DEFINED CHARACTERISTICS
AN INTERESTING CONTRAST BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC VIEWPOINTS THEN AND NOW IS AVAILABLE
WHEN YOU ADD TO THAT THAT IT IS ON THE WHOLE THE ENTERPRISING WHO IMMIGRATE AND THOSE WHO CARE MORE ABOUT FREEDOM AND ARE WILLING TO RISK THEIR SKINS FOR FREEDOM IN MANY PARTS OF EASTERN EUROPE
AND FORMERLY PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
UPON THIS POINT THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION HAS UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT BY ITS EXECUTIVE BOARD
IT PERPETUATES A DOCTRINE OF RACISM BASED ON UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTIONS IN RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENTIAL QUALITY AND POTENTIALS OF VARIOUS ETHNIC AND NATIONAL GROUPS
POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN THEIR HOMELANDS
SCANDINAVIANS
THE SAME DESIRE FOR FREEDOM WHICH MOTIVATED THE GERMAN REFUGEES OF EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT
CHAPTER TWO OF THIS REPORT REVIEWS EVIDENCE WHICH INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMMIGRATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT
IMMIGRATION OF THE SIZE CONTEMPLATED BY THIS COMMISSION CANNOT BE A FACTOR IN AGGRAVATING UNEMPLOYMENT OR DEPRESSIONS
BUT IT WAS AN INCIDENT OF THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE DEMAND
THE LITERACY OF PERSONS ADMITTED UNDER THE DISPLACED PERSONS ACT SHOWED A SURPRISING DEGREE OF SIMILARITY TO THAT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE
THE THEORY OF INHERENT RACIAL TENDENCIES TO ILLITERACY IS COMPLETELY DISPROVED BY THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS EXPERIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE CAPACITY OF DIFFERENT GROUPS TO BE EDUCATED AND AMERICANIZED
UNSUBSTANTIATED BY PHYSICAL SCIENCE
SOME FEW URGED THIS EXTREME MEASURE DURING THE COMMISSION'S HEARINGS
EACH PROSPECTIVE IMMIGRANT WOULD HAVE TO FURNISH FIRM AND LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE ASSURANCE THAT HE WOULD NOT BECOME A BURDEN ON THE COMMUNITY
THEY FAVOR PERIODIC REVISIONS IN THE IMMIGRATION QUOTA MAXIMUM BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT NEEDS AND THE NATIONAL CAPACITY TO ABSORB IMMIGRANTS
THIS PROPOSAL COULD BE COMBINED WITH ANY FORMULA FOR ALLOCATING VISAS WITHIN THE ANNUAL NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS
PROPONENTS SAY THAT FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS TO BE ADMITTED ANNUALLY IS CONFERRED UPON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
AND APPROVED BY SOME WITNESSES AT THE HEARINGS
A NUMBER OF REVISIONS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED POOLING OF UNUSED QUOTAS
THEY ALSO ASSERT THAT ANY POOLING PLAN WOULD UNBALANCE THE NATIONAL ORIGINS PATTERN
THE UNUSED EUROPEAN QUOTAS TO EUROPEANS AND THE UNUSED ASIAN QUOTAS TO ASIATICS
ELIMINATE SPECIAL RACIAL QUOTAS FOR ASIATICS AND ALSO SPECIAL QUOTAS FOR COLONIES IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
THAT THEY MUST BE RETAINED IN ORDER TO PRECLUDE EXCESSIVE IMMIGRATION OF ASIATICS FROM WESTERN HEMISPHERE COUNTRIES
RESCIND THE MORTGAGING OF QUOTAS INAUGURATED UNDER THE DISPLACED PERSONS ACT
MANY WITNESSES AT THE HEARINGS URGED IT STRONGLY
AND SUBSTITUTE A FLEXIBLE ALLOCATION WITHIN A MAXIMUM QUOTA ESTABLISHED BY LAW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL QUOTA
OPPONENTS OF THIS PLAN CLAIM THAT IT WOULD VIRTUALLY PREEMPT THE ENTIRE QUOTA FOR PARTICULAR NATIONALITY GROUPS
THE PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY FORMULA THAT IS MORALLY DEFENSIBLE AND COMPLETELY FAIR
THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION CONTEMPLATES A MAXIMUM ANNUAL NUMBER OF QUOTA IMMIGRANTS
AND A FLEXIBLE METHOD OF ALLOCATING VISAS WITHIN SUCH ANNUAL MAXIMUM
VISAS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED ON THE BASIS OF STATUTORY CATEGORIES BEST SERVING THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES
THIS ALLOCATION SHOULD BE MADE PERIODICALLY BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY
THE ARCHBISHOP OF THE CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF BOSTON STATED TO THE COMMISSION
UNDER THE NINETEEN FIFTY CENSUS THIS QUOTA CEILING WOULD TOTAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO VISAS ANNUALLY
CONGRESS HAD TO BYPASS THAT SYSTEM BY ENACTING THE DISPLACED PERSONS ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT
WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON EXISTING WORLD CONDITIONS
ESCAPEES AND THE REMAINING DISPLACED PERSONS IN EUROPE COULD BRING SUBSTANTIAL ALLEVIATION TO THE EMERGENCY PROBLEM THERE CAUSED BY WORLD WAR TWO AND ITS AFTERMATH
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT ONE OF THE CATEGORIES SHOULD BE FOR IMMIGRANTS WHOSE ADMISSION WOULD RESULT IN REUNITING FAMILIES
AND THAT NATION'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEFENSE AGAINST THE TOTALITARIAN MENACE IS LESSENED
A FEW COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD THROUGH EARLY REGISTRATION FOR VISAS MIGHT MONOPOLIZE THIS PART OF THE QUOTA
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE ALLOCATION OF VISAS WITHIN THE PROPOSED ANNUAL MAXIMUM QUOTA
THE NUMBER OF VISAS
THREE THAT THERE BE PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE THESE DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE
SUBMIT OTHER ALLOCATIONS TO MEET EMERGENCIES
SUCH NEW INTERIM ALLOCATIONS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME PROCEDURE AS THOSE ORIGINALLY MADE
THE VISA DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS ADVISED THE COMMISSION THAT ON THE BASIS OF PRESENT VISA CONTROL EXPERIENCE
RESTRICTIONS UPON IMMIGRATION IT IS INTENDED THAT THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSED UNIFIED QUOTA SYSTEM WILL INCLUDE QUALITATIVE RESTRICTIONS UPON INDIVIDUAL IMMIGRANTS
THAT PRESENT DUPLICATION OF FUNCTIONS BETWEEN THE CONSULAR OFFICERS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE IMMIGRANT INSPECTORS IN THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BE ELIMINATED
THAT A BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS BE CREATED UNDER THE PROPOSED COMMISSION
DEPORTATIONS
THE APPREHENSION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ALIENS
THIS LAW WAS PASSED IN A PERIOD OF MANPOWER SHORTAGE DURING THE CIVIL WAR
THE SERVICE FUNCTIONED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF LABOR
DEPARTMENT OF STATE THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR VESTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VISA FUNCTION
WHICH CONSISTS OF THE GRANTING OR DENIAL OF VISAS IN CONSULAR OFFICERS OF THE AMERICAN FOREIGN SERVICE ABROAD
THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE OR DENY VISAS IS CLEARLY AND EXCLUSIVELY VESTED IN THE CONSULAR OFFICERS
THE REQUIREMENT OF A VISA TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY IS RELATIVELY NEW
THIS REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN VISAS FROM AMERICAN CONSULAR OFFICERS ABROAD WAS GIVEN STATUTORY RECOGNITION IN THE ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
AN IMMIGRANT WAS PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES UNLESS HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF AN UNEXPIRED IMMIGRATION VISA
THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH A VISA BY AN AMERICAN CONSULAR OFFICER DOES NOT GUARANTEE HIS ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES
TO AID IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VISA FUNCTIONS ABROAD UNDER THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
A VISA DIVISION WAS CREATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF THE VISA AND PASSPORT DIVISIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS
THE SUBCOMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUREAU OF PASSPORTS AND VISAS AS AN INDEPENDENT UNIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
TO MEET OBJECTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THE BILL WAS REVISED TO ESTABLISH A BUREAU OF SECURITY AND CONSULAR AFFAIRS RESPONSIBLE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
AND CLOSELY INTEGRATED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S FRAMEWORK
WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE PROCEDURES AND THE ANOMALOUS POSITION OF THE BOARD OF REVIEW WERE SUBJECTED TO INCREASING CRITICISM
THE BOARD NEITHER INITIATES NOR PROSECUTES THE CASES WHICH ARE BROUGHT BEFORE IT BUT IN EFFECT SITS AS A COURT
ITS HEARINGS ARE PUBLIC AND ITS DECISIONS ARE REPORTED
UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF FUNCTIONS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR THAT APPROVAL MUST BE OBTAINED OVERSEAS BEFORE THE ALIEN COULD EMBARK FOR THE UNITED STATES WAS AN IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT OVER EARLIER PROCEDURES
THE CONSULAR FUNCTION IS AN OLD AND IMPORTANT ONE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS REPORTED TO THE COMMISSION THAT ONLY THREE PERCENT OF VISA OFFICERS HAVE HAD LEGAL TRAINING DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VISA ISSUING OFFICER IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH A GREAT BODY OF COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS
SOON AFTER OPERATIONS COMMENCED UNDER THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR IT BECAME APPARENT THAT CONSULAR OFFICERS OFTEN LACKED ADEQUATE TRAINING AND BACKGROUND TO DISCHARGE THEIR NEW RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
THESE DEFICIENCIES RESULTED IN A CONSIDERABLE VOLUME OF REJECTIONS AT PORTS OF ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES OF ALIENS WHO HAD BEEN GRANTED VISAS
THE HOOVER COMMISSION MADE TWO PERTINENT RECOMMENDATIONS ONE
THE FUNCTIONS OF VISA CONTROL SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
THE HOOVER COMMISSION TASK FORCE REPORT ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS ELABORATED IN TWO STATEMENTS
EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO DIPLOMATIC VISAS
FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE HOOVER REPORT
THIS TABLE REVEALS THAT DURING NINETEEN FIFTY ONE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND ALIENS IN POSSESSION OF VISAS WERE EXCLUDED BY IMMIGRATION OFFICERS AT THE PORTS OF ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES
IN THE COMMISSION'S OPINION
NOR IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SUGGESTING THAT FOREIGN POLICY REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF ADMISSIBILITY BY CONSULAR OFFICERS AT THE PORT OF ENTRY IN THE UNITED STATES
IN SUCH PLACES VISA ISSUANCE IS A FULL TIME JOB FOR VISA OFFICERS
THERE MAY BE SOME REARRANGEMENT NECESSARY FOR OPERATION IN ISOLATED AREAS FROM WHICH FEW APPLICATIONS FOR VISAS ORIGINATE AND WHERE
FULL TIME VISA OFFICERS ARE NOT STATIONED
TO SATISFY ANY REQUIREMENTS OF PROTOCOL SUCH OFFICERS COULD BE ATTACHED FOR TECHNICAL PURPOSES TO OUR EMBASSIES OR OTHER ACCREDITED OFFICES WITH CONVENTIONAL TITLES
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRESENT PROCEDURES AND THE CONSOLIDATED PROCEDURE THE COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED
INCLUDING SUGGESTED APPELLATE PROCEDURES
ONE ENFORCEMENT THIS INCLUDES VISA ISSUANCE
TWO ADJUDICATION THIS INCLUDES THE DETERMINATION OF CASES AND OF THEIR APPEALS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS
THE FACT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ARE UNSATISFACTORY
THEN ADVISORY
DURING THE COMMISSION'S HEARINGS THERE WAS A DIVERSITY OF SENTIMENT ON THIS SUBJECT
THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS INTRODUCE A NEW FUNCTION NOT NOW VESTED IN EITHER OF THE TWO DEPARTMENTS
THE ALLOCATION OF VISAS
THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED AGREEMENT WITH THE HOOVER COMMISSION THAT IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO PUT THESE FUNCTIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
THE HOOVER COMMISSION NATURALLY DID NOT CONSIDER THE PROPOSED NEW FUNCTIONS OF VISA ALLOCATION
THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE CONDUCTS ITS SECURITY FUNCTIONS THROUGH ITS OWN INVESTIGATIVE UNIT WHICH IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
ITS LIAISON WITH THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION COULD BE JUST AS CLOSE IF THE TWO INVESTIGATIVE UNITS WERE IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS PRIMARILY A LITIGATING AND PROSECUTING AGENCY
WITH THE ISSUANCE OF VISAS TO INDIVIDUAL APPLICANTS ABROAD
THE IMMIGRATION POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES CANNOT BE BASED SOLELY UPON MANPOWER OR LABOR CONSIDERATIONS
IT IS ARGUED THAT SUCH A CHANGE WOULD BE DESIRABLE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FEDERAL SECURITY AGENCY'S INTEREST IN PEOPLE AS SUCH
COUPLED WITH THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY FOR VISA ALLOCATIONS
PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE VISA ALLOCATION AUTHORITY
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR VISA ALLOCATION DECISIONS
IF NOT MANDATORY
WOULD BE A BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS
THAT BOARD WOULD HAVE FINAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATIONS IN EXCLUSION AND DEPORTATION CASES
THE BOARD WOULD HEAR APPEALS IN VISA CASES AND WOULD ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ALIEN MAY BE EXCLUDED WITHOUT A HEARING IN SECURITY CASES
IT WOULD PRODUCE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND COORDINATED ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD ASSURE THE REQUIRED HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATION OF ALLOCATIONS TO BE MADE WITHIN THE UNIFIED QUOTA SYSTEM
IF THIS COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION IS ADOPTED
AND BY THE VISA DIVISION
PERFORMING FUNCTIONS AFFECTING IMMIGRATION IN WASHINGTON AND IN THE CONSULAR OFFICES OVERSEAS
THE TRANSFER OF PERSONNEL WORKING ON VISA MATTERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND EXERCISING THE VISA FUNCTION ABROAD LIKEWISE SHOULD PRESENT NO SERIOUS DIFFICULTY
IT SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED WHICH EMPLOYEES IN THE BUREAU OF SECURITY AND CONSULAR AFFAIRS AND WHICH OF OUR CONSULAR OFFICERS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN VISA ACTIVITIES
ANY TRANSFER OF PERSONNEL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO THE NEW COMMISSION SHOULD BE MADE WITHOUT PREJUDICING ANY STATUS
THE PRESENT LACK OF ANY FORMAL REVIEW OF A CONSULAR DENIAL OF A VISA
FAIR HEARING AND PROCEDURE IN EXCLUSION AND DEPORTATION THAT A BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS BE ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE
TO BE CONCERNED EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE ADJUDICATION OF CASES ARISING UNDER THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
THAT DEPORTATION HEARINGS BE CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
THAT THE CALIBER OF HEARING EXAMINERS BE IMPROVED
THAT THERE BE NO JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ACTIONS DENYING A VISA
BY EXPRESS PROVISION OF LAW NO ONE CAN REVIEW HIS DECISION ON A VISA APPLICATION
THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS CHARGED WITH THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS NO POWER TO CONTROL OR DIRECT THE CONSULS IN CERTAIN VISA ACTIVITIES
IT WAS REPEATEDLY TESTIFIED AT THE COMMISSION'S HEARINGS THAT SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE ABSOLUTISM WAS UNPARALLELED IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF AMERICAN LAW
IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S STUDY THE CHIEF PURPOSE FOR VESTING SUCH COMPLETE AUTHORITY IN A SUBORDINATE OFFICIAL DOUBTLESS WAS THE COMMITTEE'S DESIRE TO PLACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN THE WAY OF UNDESIRABLE ALIENS
THAT TO ALLOW AN APPEAL FROM A CONSUL'S DENIAL OF A VISA WOULD BE TO MAKE A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF A RIGHT WHEN
AN ALIEN HAS NO RIGHT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE REFUSAL OF A VISA IS NOT AN INVASION OF HIS RIGHTS
EVERY WITNESS BEFORE THE COMMISSION WHO DISCUSSED THE CONSUL'S ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
WE SEARCH IN VAIN FOR ANY PARALLEL IN OUR INSTITUTIONS FOR THIS DESPOTIC CONSULAR ABSOLUTISM
ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF A VISA FREQUENTLY INVOLVES COMPLICATED LEGAL PROBLEMS OF ELIGIBILITY AND DETERMINATIONS OF FOREIGN LAW
THE VISA ISSUING CONSULAR OFFICERS ARE GENERALLY JUNIOR AND SUBORDINATE OFFICERS IN OUR CONSULATES
THE COMMISSION FINDS NO PERSUASIVE REASON WHY THE DETERMINATIONS OF A CONSULAR OFFICER IN VISA CASES SHOULD NOT BE REVIEWED
GIVING OPPORTUNITY FOR APPEAL ON THE DENIAL OF A VISA
PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN COMPARABLE SITUATIONS WHICH ARE PRECEDENTS FOR THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS
WORLD WAR TWO VISA REVIEW PROCEDURES
ELABORATE PROCEDURES TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR VISAS WERE IN EFFECT DURING WORLD WAR TWO UNDER SUCH PROCEDURES
ALL VISA APPLICATIONS OF ALIENS SEEKING TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES
THE PROCEDURE FOR SUCH REVIEW OF PROSPECTIVE VISA ACTION REQUIRED THE ALIEN TO SUBMIT DETAILED INFORMATION IN WRITING
THE REVIEW AGENCIES HAD A COMPLETE RECORD WHICH INCLUDED SUCH ITEMS AS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CONSULAR OFFICER HANDLING THE CASE ABROAD
THEY WERE SENT ON TO THE VISA ISSUING OFFICERS AS ADVISORY OPINIONS
THE CASES WENT ON TO THE SECOND LINK IN THE CHAIN OF REVIEW PROCEDURES
IT BECAME THE DEPARTMENT'S ADVISORY OPINION
THE BOARD OF APPEALS ON VISA CASES WHICH CONSIDERED THE WHOLE FILE
IT HELD NO HEARINGS
PRESENT VISA REVIEW PROCEDURES
IN REFUSING ISSUANCE OF A VISA
ALTHOUGH IN THEORY THERE IS A REVIEW OF CONSULAR ACTION PRIOR TO FINAL DETERMINATION
THE CHIEF OF THE VISA DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE ALSO ADVISED THE COMMISSION OF THE PROCEDURES IN EFFECT CONCERNING CASES IN WHICH ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN ON A VISA APPLICATION
WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CONSULAR OFFICER AT A POST
THE CASE MAY BE RECONSIDERED IN THE VISA DIVISION
RATHER THEY PARTAKE LARGELY OF THE NATURE OF MANAGEMENT OR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISORY AND REPORTING DEVICES
FOUR THE CONSUL IS NOT BOUND BY THE ADVISORY OPINION
RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE VISA OFFICER ABROAD
AND IN GENERAL ALL MATERIAL WHICH BEARS DIRECTLY UPON THE ISSUE WHICH ENABLES THE REVIEWING AUTHORITY TO FORMULATE A REASONED ADVISORY OPINION
THE RECORD MUST CONTAIN ALL DATA OBTAINABLE WHICH RELATES TO THE APPLICANT'S STATUS AS A POSSIBLE SECURITY THREAT
THERE ALSO ARE PROCEDURES TO REVIEW CONSULAR ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PASSPORTS
SINCE NINETEEN FORTY ONE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PERMITTING REVIEW OF CONSULAR DECISIONS DENYING PASSPORTS
THE COMMISSION IS INFORMED THAT THE FACTS IN THE DEPARTMENT'S POSSESSION ARE DISCLOSED IN SUCH HEARINGS AND THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED IS GIVEN FULL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIS CASE
AS A RESULT OF CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE PROCEDURES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN DENYING PASSPORTS FOR SECURITY REASONS
PROVISION IS MADE FOR TENTATIVE DISAPPROVALS OF PASSPORT APPLICATIONS
WHERE A CONSULAR OFFICER REFUSES A CERTIFICATE OF IDENTITY AND AN APPEAL IS TAKEN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
THESE PRECEDENTS INDICATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING CONSULAR ACTIONS ON VISA APPLICATIONS
RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION IS CONVINCED THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL REASON FOR CONTINUING THE PRESENT SYSTEM UNDER WHICH THE CONSULAR OFFICER'S DETERMINATIONS IN VISA CASES ARE FINAL AND NOT REVIEWABLE AS OF RIGHT
THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS
WHERE A VISA IS DENIED
THERE SHOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT OF A FORMAL HEARING BEFORE THE VISA ISSUING OFFICER
CONSULAR DECISIONS CONCERNING A VISA TAKE PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND BEFORE AN ALIEN HAS SEVERED HIS TIES ABROAD
CURRENT HEARING PROCEDURES EXCLUSION EXAMINATION UPON ARRIVAL
CONGRESS HAS PROVIDED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS IN CASES OF ARRIVING ALIENS WHOSE ADMISSIBILITY TO THE UNITED STATES IS QUESTIONED
THE COURTS HAVE DECLARED THAT SUCH HEARINGS
THE HEARINGS WERE CONDUCTED BY THREE MEMBER BOARDS OF SPECIAL INQUIRY
THE PROCEDURE ON THE ALIEN'S ARRIVAL IS SET OUT IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL IN THE STATUTE
IF THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER QUESTIONS THE APPLICANT'S RIGHT TO ENTER
THE COURTS HAVE INSISTED THAT DEPORTATION HEARINGS MUST CONFORM MOST SCRUPULOUSLY TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF FAIR PLAY
APPLICATION IS MADE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT OF ARREST
IF THE ALIEN'S DEPORTATION EVENTUALLY IS ORDERED
AUTHORITIES IN LEGAL FIELDS HAVE LONG CONDEMNED PROCEDURES UNDER WHICH THE SAME OFFICIALS
AND PROVISION FOR INDEPENDENT HEARING EXAMINERS
PAST STUDIES OF IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES DURING THE LAST FORTY YEARS
THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST EIGHT APPRAISALS OF THIS ISSUE BY VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS
THE HOOVER COMMISSION ON LAW OBSERVANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
OF CONDUCTING HEARINGS ON THE WARRANTS
THESE APPOINTEES WOULD ACT AS OFFICERS OF THE BOARD IN THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AND WOULD BE UNDER ITS SOLE JURISDICTION
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMITTEE LIKEWISE CRITICIZED THE PRACTICE OF COMBINING THE PROSECUTING AND ADJUDICATING FUNCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
A SIMILAR RESULT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT THE LEVEL OF FINAL DECISION ON REVIEW BY THE AGENCY HEADS BY PERMITTING THE VIEWS OF THE INVESTIGATORS AND ADVOCATES TO BE PRESENTED ONLY IN OPEN HEARINGS WHERE THEY CAN BE KNOWN AND MET BY THOSE WHO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THEM
THE COMMITTEE ALSO CONSIDERED THE ADVISABILITY OF COMPLETELY SEVERING ADJUDICATION FROM PROSECUTION BY CREATING SEPARATE AGENCIES TO HANDLE EACH
IT SUBMITTED NO RECOMMENDATION FOR CHANGE IN THE DEPORTATION PROCEDURES
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT A DOMINANT NOTE IN MANY OF THESE INQUIRIES IS THEIR CRITICISM OF THE FAILURE TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR DIVISION BETWEEN THE PROSECUTING AND ADJUDICATING FUNCTIONS OF IMMIGRATION OFFICERS
WERE ITS PROVISIONS FOR SAFEGUARDING THE INDEPENDENCE OF HEARING EXAMINERS
THAT SUCH EXAMINERS SHOULD PERFORM NO DUTIES INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR DUTIES AS EXAMINERS
THE STATUTE PROHIBITED PRIVATE CONSULTATION BY EXAMINERS WITH AGENCY OFFICERS
FORBADE OFFICERS ENGAGED IN INVESTIGATIVE AND PROSECUTING FUNCTIONS IN A CASE FROM ENGAGING IN THE DECISION OF THAT CASE
AND A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE IN EACH AGENCY'S HEARING EXAMINERS
WHERE WE FREQUENTLY MEET WITH A VOTELESS CLASS OF LITIGANTS WHO NOT ONLY LACK THE INFLUENCE OF CITIZENS
THE SUPREME COURT DECISION DEALT ONLY WITH DEPORTATION HEARINGS
THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT YET PASSED UPON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT TO EXCLUSION HEARINGS
WITH SOME CONSPICUOUS EXCEPTIONS BOTH ADMISSION AND EXPULSION PROCEDURES HAVE ADVANCED STEADILY TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GREATER FAIRNESS
BUT NOTES THAT SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT REPEATEDLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HEAVIEST ASSAULT BY RESPONSIBLE AND INFORMED OBSERVERS ARE STILL UNREMEDIED
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS A STATUTORY BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS
THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD ASSURING FAIR HEARINGS FOR ALIENS
ALIENS SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO BRING APPEAL TO THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF FEES
THOSE WHO HAVE APPRAISED THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS LIKEWISE HAVE CONDEMNED ITS MIXTURE OF PROSECUTING AND ADJUDICATIVE FUNCTIONS
THEY HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS A ROADBLOCK TO IMPARTIAL CONSIDERATION
THE CURRENT HEARING PROCEDURES SHOULD BE EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MANDATES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
IN THIS CONNECTION THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT PROVIDES ONE THAT HEARING OFFICERS SHALL PERFORM NO DUTIES INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS HEARING EXAMINERS
TWO THAT INVESTIGATIVE AND PROSECUTING OFFICERS SHALL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY DECISIONS
THE PRESENT HEARING PROCEDURE IN DEPORTATION AND EXCLUSION CASES FAILS TO CONFORM TO THE NOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS FOR FAIR HEARINGS
OFFICERS NORMALLY PERFORMING INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING DUTIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT IMMIGRATION HEARINGS
ANOTHER MAJOR FACET OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT IS THE REMOVAL OF HEARING EXAMINERS FROM THE SUPERVISION OF OFFICERS PERFORMING PROSECUTING AND INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTIONS
CLOSELY RELATED TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF HEARING EXAMINERS IS THEIR COMPENSATION
THE COMMISSION BELIEVES IT IMPERATIVE NOT ONLY THAT IMMIGRATION HEARINGS ACCORD A MAXIMUM OF FAIRNESS
THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS WOULD BE A STATUTORY BOARD WHOSE MEMBERS WOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION
THE BOARD WOULD BE CONCERNED EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE ADJUDICATION OF CASES ARISING UNDER THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ADJUDICATION WOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN THE BOARD
ITS DECISIONS WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVELY FINAL ON ALL ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE NEW PROPOSED COMMISSION ONLY IN REGARD TO THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE EXAMINERS WHO HEAR AND DECIDE EXCLUSION AND DEPORTATION CASES BE SEPARATED FROM ANY ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS
THIS WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED PRINCIPALLY BY PLACING SUCH EXAMINERS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION AND VISA APPEALS AND REMOVING THEM FROM THE CONTROL AND DIRECTION OF ANY ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
SUCH EXAMINERS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PERFORMING ANY DUTIES OUTSIDE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AS HEARING OFFICERS
A NUMBER OF WITNESSES HAVE URGED ALSO THAT THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT BE APPLIED TO IMMIGRATION HEARINGS
THE SPEARHEAD OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION
WE DO NOT DOUBT THE GOOD FAITH OF THE SERVICE NOR ITS DISPOSITION TO GIVE FAIR HEARINGS
WELL CONSIDERED VIEW OF THE MINIMAL PROCEDURAL PROTECTION NEEDED IN A TRIAL INVOLVING ACCUSATORY ELEMENTS
THE NEED FOR INVOKING THE PURELY PROCEDURAL DIRECTIVES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT DOUBTLESS WILL BE LESSENED BY THE ADOPTION OF THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SEPARATION OF ADJUDICATIVE FUNCTIONS FROM ENFORCEMENT
LACKING THE RELATIVE INDEPENDENCE OF EXAMINERS CHOSEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
AND TO BRING THE DEPORTATION PROCESS IN LINE WITH THE UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT DEPORTATION HEARINGS BE CONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
AND THAT IF ALL ALIENS CHARGED IN DEPORTATION CASES DEMANDED HEARINGS THE EXTRA ANNUAL EXPENSE MIGHT REACH TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS
IF HEARINGS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT IT WOULD STILL BE PERMISSIBLE FOR THE SERVICE TO PERMIT VOLUNTARY DEPARTURE WITHOUT BRINGING THE CASE TO A HEARING
NO FACTUAL BASIS WHATEVER HAS BEEN OFFERED TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT EVERY ALIEN APPREHENDED BECAUSE ILLEGALLY HERE
OR ANY NUMBER OF ALIENS GREATER THAN THOSE NOW ACCORDED HEARINGS
THE COMMISSION BELIEVES ITS RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH DEPORTATION HEARINGS MEET THE SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR A FAIR HEARING
THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO ATTEMPT TO USE THAT ACT TO CONTROL THE PROCEDURE OF VISA ISSUING OFFICERS STATIONED OVERSEAS
THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE SUCH VISA OFFICERS SHOULD BE FREE FROM UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS
THIS PROCEDURE WOULD PROVIDE APPRECIABLY GREATER ASSURANCES OF FAIR PLAY TO THE APPLICANT FOR A VISA THAN IS AVAILABLE UNDER PRESENT LAW
SUCH IMPROVEMENT WILL FOLLOW TO SOME EXTENT FROM THE SEVERANCE OF ADJUDICATION FROM ADMINISTRATION
BUT CHANGED ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT WILL NOT IN ITSELF MEET THE NEED
THAT SHE HAS BEEN DENIED HER RIGHT TO HAVE THE RESPONSE OF EVERY JUROR TO THE QUESTION
JAMES MCGINTY
RICHARD CROWLEY U S ATTORNEY
THE DOCTRINE IS WELL STATED BY GODWIN IN HIS TREATISE ON POLITICAL JUSTICE
A RESULT WHICH WAS WELL EPITOMIZED BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN
AS ALLEGED BY GODWIN
IF A MARRIED WOMAN IS SLANDERED SHE CAN PROSECUTE IN HER OWN NAME THE SLANDERER
THESE ARE CERTAINLY GREAT AMELIORATIONS OF THE LAW
I AM NOT A BELIEVER IN POLITICAL PANACEAS BUT IF I MISTAKE NOT
WOULD WIDOWS FOR AGES HAVE BEEN BURNED ON THE FUNERAL PYRES OF THEIR DECEASED HUSBANDS
THERE HAS BEEN NO AUTHORITATIVE ADJUDICATION UPON IT
IN GIVING IT THEIR IMPRIMATUR
BUT IT DEMANDS THAT THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF ALL CITIZENS SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY UNABRIDGED
A VICIOUS WILL MUST CONCUR WITH A WRONGFUL ACT
THAT THE ESSENCE OF AN OFFENCE IS THE WRONGFUL INTENT WITHOUT WHICH IT CANNOT EXIST
MAY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HIS IGNORANCE OR MISINFORMATION IN A MATTER OF LAW
AND THE ORDINARY DISCOVERY OF A FELONIOUS INTENT IS
THOUGH A WRONGFUL ACT MAY BE DONE IN PURSUANCE OF IT
BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS OF THE COUNTRY FOR ADJUDICATION
THE CASE OF MYRA BRADWELL
NO JUROR SPOKE A WORD DURING THE TRIAL
FROM THE TIME THEY WERE IMPANELLED TO THE TIME OF THEIR DISCHARGE
AND NO JUROR EXPRESSED HIS DISSENT
NO JUROR EXPRESSED HIS DISSENT
BUT BY A NOD WHICH APPEARED TO BE MADE BY EACH JUROR
HOW THEN COULD THE DEFENDANT BE LAWFULLY DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO ASK EVERY JUROR IF THE VERDICT HAD HIS ASSENT

RICHARD CROWLEY U S ATTORNEY
HANNAH CHATFIELD
I THINK I SAW NANCY M CHATFIELD REGISTER
HE WAS RESTORED BY MANDAMUS
WHEREIN HE IS COMPELLABLE TO ACT
AND BY THE ADJUDICATION WHICH WAS MADE THIS MORNING
A JUROR WE STAND ELEVEN FOR CONVICTION AND ONE OPPOSED
A JUROR I DON'T WISH TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS
EACH JUROR ANSWERING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE TO THE QUESTION
JUST PREVIOUS TO THE TIME FIXED FOR THE SITTING OF THE BOARD OF REGISTRARS IN THE FIRST DISTRICT OF THE EIGHTH WARD OF ROCHESTER
THAT OUR DUTIES AS REGISTRARS WOULD ALLOW
HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED AND REAFFIRMED BY THE LEADING STATESMEN OF THE NATION
BY EXEMPTING THEM FROM TAXATION
THE BLACK WOMAN'S NAME WOULD BE PUT ON THE ASSESSOR'S LIST
HIS WIDOW'S NAME WILL GO DOWN ON THE ASSESSOR'S LIST
APPLIED FOR A WRIT OF EJECTMENT AT THE LAND OFFICE IN OREGON CITY
BANCROFT SAYS VIRGINIA WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF LIBERTY
THERE IS NOT A WORD IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH MILITATES AGAINST THE RECOGNITION OF WOMAN AS A PERSON
AND AN ACT OF UNAUTHORIZED AUTHORITY
BUT THE PROSECUTION IS ALSO AN ADMISSION OF UNAUTHORIZED AUTHORITY IN THAT BY IT
UNDER THIS VIEW OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE SUCH PERSON CANNOT FAIL TO SEE THERE HAS BEEN UNAUTHORIZED INTERFERENCE BY THE UNITED STATES
THAT AN ORDINARY JUROR
HONESTLY MAKES UP HIS MIND THAT HE HAS A RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE TOWN OF A IN THIS BELIEF HE APPLIES TO THE REGISTRARS OF THAT TOWN
THEY MAY ACT UNWISELY AND UNCONSCIENTIOUSLY
AN APPLICATION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUND OF ERRONEOUS RULINGS BY THE JUDGE
AND WHOSE ERRONEOUS RULINGS ARE COMPLAINED OF
SUPERSEDES THE NECESSITY OF PRESENTING IN THIS PLACE ANY SUMMARY OF ITS CONTENTS
ON THE PROPER AND COMMODIOUS CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
THAT THE SCHOOLHOUSES IN MOST OF THE DISTRICTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE OF AN IMPERFECT CONSTRUCTION
SCHOOLHOUSES MUCH MORE CONDUCIVE TO THE HEALTH AND COMFORT
TO PREPARE AND SUBMIT A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
WITH A VIEW TO INDUCE THE TOWNS OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO ADOPT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
BY THE BRIEFNESS OF THE TIME
TO INSPECT THE CONDITION OF MANY SCHOOLHOUSES
THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES CONNECTS ITSELF CLOSELY WITH THE LOVE OF STUDY
THAT IT ENLISTS ALL THE GOOD MOTIVES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE BAD SIDE
THAT VERY MANY JUDICIOUS MEN MAINTAIN THE EXPEDIENCY OF VESTING THE WHOLE POWER OF EMPLOYING TEACHERS IN THE TOWN COMMITTEE
ALL DECRY THEIR PREDECESSORS
IF NOT TO CAPACITATE THEM FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR DELICATE AND ARDUOUS WORK
IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO ATTRIBUTE THE OMISSION EVEN OF THIS IMPORTANT DUTY TO ANY PECULIAR DEADNESS OR DORMANCY
WHILE THE OFFICE OF SELECTMAN AND OF REPRESENTATIVE TO THE GENERAL COURT IS OFTEN AN OBJECT OF AVIDITY
AND TO OBTAIN THEIR DISTRIBUTIVE SHARE OF THE SCHOOL FUND
UNDOUBTEDLY SUCH UNBOUGHT EFFORTS WOULD INFUSE INTO THE SYSTEM A QUICKER LIFE AND A HIGHER ENERGY
SO SELF ABASED AS TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR ABASEMENT
AND UNDERSTAND SO WELL THE NECESSITY OF A SKILFUL PREPARATION OF MEANS FOR ITS BESTOWMENT
WHERE EVERY BIAS OF MY INFORMANTS WOULD LEAD THEM TO EXTENUATE AND NOT TO MAGNIFY THE FACTS
OR HOUSEHOLDERS TAKEN HERE TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THREE THOUSAND INHABITANTS
HAD I NOT ADOPTED THIS MOST EXCULPATORY CONSTRUCTION
DETERIORATED IN QUALITY
SO PRONE TO TRICKISHNESS
SEMINARIES FOR HIGHER LEARNING
TO PREVENT THE SCHOOL FROM BEING CONVERTED INTO AN ENGINE OF RELIGIOUS PROSELYTISM
NO ONE WOULD DESIRE A REPEAL OF THIS LAW WHILE THE DANGER IMPENDS WHICH IT WAS DESIGNED TO REPEL
EXPOSITORY OF THE DOCTRINES OF REVEALED RELIGION
THE INDISPENSABLENESS OF MORAL INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING
ENTIRELY TO DISCARD THE INCULCATION OF THE GREAT DOCTRINES OF MORALITY AND OF NATURAL THEOLOGY HAS A VEHEMENT TENDENCY TO DRIVE MANKIND INTO OPPOSITE EXTREMES
THEY WILL BE ENROLLED AMONG THE ARBITERS OF A NATION'S DESTINY
WHO STARTLE AT THE MISPRONUNCIATION OF A WORD
AN ABROGATION OF THE WISDOM OF PROVIDENCE
ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EXIGENT WANTS OF OUR SCHOOLS AT THE PRESENT TIME
IT WOULD BE THE WANT OF SPACIOUS AND CONVENIENT SCHOOLHOUSES
THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES CONNECTS ITSELF CLOSELY WITH THE LOVE OF STUDY
REVISITS THE HIGHER LATITUDES
BUT IN REGARD TO SCHOOLHOUSES WHICH ARE BUILT AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE
SO SHOULD IT BE WITH THE AIR WE RESPIRE
ONCE RESPIRED
WHILE A CURRENT OF THE RESPIRED AIR FLOWS OUT OF IT
UNLESS SEVERAL ROOMFULS OF AIR BE ADMITTED
WHERE THE SCHOOLROOM HAS BEEN SO FAULTILY CONSTRUCTED
THE HEAT WHICH IT IS CONSTANTLY ABSTRACTING BY CONTACT WITH ITS SURFACE
THE FIRST METHOD SUPERSEDES THE NECESSITY OF RAISING A LID
OR WHEN SOME TRIBES OF INDIANS MAKE THEIR CHILDREN'S HEADS AS SQUARE AS A JOINER'S BOX
FROM THE BAD CONSTRUCTION OF OUR SCHOOLHOUSES
IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
THE INSTRUCTOR'S DESK SHOULD BE UPON A PLATFORM
THE DESKS MAY BE PLACED LONGITUDINALLY
LOCATION OF SCHOOLHOUSES ALL PHILOSOPHERS AGREE THAT EXTERNAL OBJECTS AFFECT TEMPER AND CHARACTER
AND THE MODESTY OF NATURE WILL BE OVERLAID WITH HABITS OF INDECORUM
WE ARE PERSUADED THAT SCHOOLHOUSES WILL BE MORE READILY BUILT AND REPAIRED
NOT EXCEPTING OUR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES
FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF MANY OF OUR SCHOOLHOUSES
MANY SCHOOLHOUSES IN THE COUNTRY ARE SITUATED A HUNDRED RODS OR MORE FROM ANY DWELLING HOUSE
I HAVE SUGGESTED DEFECTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR SCHOOLHOUSES ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MORE SPECIFICALLY POINTING OUT IMPROVEMENTS
THAT A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOLHOUSES WERE NOT ONLY ILL ADAPTED TO ENCOURAGE MENTAL EFFORT
DEEPLY AND WIDELY DEFICIENT IN THE TWO INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITES FOR THEIR OFFICE
WHAT AGGRAVATES THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO
THE SCHOOLHOUSES IN THAT CITY WERE WITHOUT VENTILATION
HAS ATTENDED TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF BAD INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS AND BAD LOCATIONS FOR SCHOOLHOUSES UPON THE HEALTH OF THE PUPILS
THE REPORT ON SCHOOLHOUSES
THE SELECTION OF MOTIVES TO ENKINDLE THE ARDOR OF CHILDREN IN THEIR STUDIES
WHOLLY IMPUTABLE TO TEACHERS
AND OF ADJUSTING THE LANGUAGE USED TO VARIOUS EXTENTS OF MEANING
KNOWS THAT NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THOSE LITIGATED CASES
CONSUMMATING ACT AND EFFORT OF THE LEARNER
ADOPTIVE
THAT IT IS SAID WE HAVE BUT TWO OR THREE CLASSES OF UNIFORMLY CORRECT SPELLERS
WHERE IS THE ALPHABETIC SOUND OF O IN THE WORDS WORD
FROM THE TWO ALPHABETIC SOUNDS
WE HAVE SO FEW GOOD SPELLERS
THEY RARELY BECOME GOOD SPELLERS AFTERWARDS
IN WHICH WORDS ARE ARRANGED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR INTELLIGIBLENESS TO CHILDREN
AND AN INVETERATE HABIT IS FORMED OF DISSOCIATING THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE
WITH THEIR CONNECTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OUTRUNNING THE COURSE OF TIME
HAVE FORMED SUMMARIES
WOULD NOT SUFFICE TO INDICATE THE SLOWER OR SWIFTER ENUNCIATION OF EMPHATIC OR UNEMPHATIC WORDS
SO PERFECT ARE UNDRILLED CHILDREN IN THIS MATTER
URGING IT TO SEARCH OUT THE TOTALITY OF ANY SUBJECT
HOW CAN A JUROR JUDGE OF THE SOUNDNESS OR FALLACY OF AN ADVOCATE'S ARGUMENT
OF COURSE ALL CONSECUTIVENESS OF THOUGHT IS DISPERSED BY A SCRAP BOOK
FOR WHILE THE WORDS COME ALPHABETICALLY THE IDEAS COME CHAOTICALLY
AND PERHAPS ENTOMOLOGY
IF THE PUPIL'S KNOWLEDGE OUTRUNS HIS LANGUAGE
ARE ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ONE TO UNDERSTAND A BUCCANEER'S HISTORY
AND ALL ITS INTOXICATING INCIDENTS OF PIRACIES
IN ORDER TO ENTITLE A TOWN TO RECEIVE ITS DISTRIBUTIVE SHARE OF THE INCOME OF THE SCHOOL FUND
HAD NOT FOUND ANY BOOKS AT ONCE EXPOSITORY OF THE DOCTRINES OF REVEALED RELIGION
RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
AND INCAPACITATES US FOR ALL MENTAL EFFORTS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN REACHED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLHOUSES
I HAVE SAID THAT SCHOOLHOUSES SHOULD HAVE CELLARS UNDER THEM
THIS IS BOTH UNNATURAL AND UNHEALTHFUL
WE FIND NO PARTICULAR INCONVENIENCE FROM RESPIRING AIR AT THE TEMPERATURE OF NINETY DEGREES ON THE ONE HAND
IT PROSTRATES OR PARALYZES
AND THE TENDENCY TO LOCAL OR GENERAL INFLAMMATIONS AND CONGESTIONS OF BLOOD IS MUCH LESS IN COLD THAN IN WARM CLIMATES
OR TO EXAMINE THE TEXTURE OF THE GOSSAMER'S WEB
AND IF YOU TELL THE MASTER HE IS PERILLING THE EYESIGHT OF HIS SCHOLARS
AND WHOSE BOOKS OR REPORTS DO NOT NEED ERRATA AS LARGE AS THEMSELVES
IT WILL BE DISROBED OF MANY OF ITS CHOICEST BEAUTIES
BY THE ORDINATIONS OF PROVIDENCE
UTILITY OUTRANKS ELEGANCE
HENCE THEY SUPPOSE AND REPRESENT A STATE OF SOCIETY WHERE WEALTH OUTRANKS VIRTUE
HAVE BEEN REPUBLISHED
IF THE NECESSITY OF THEIR CONDITION DEBARS THEM FROM VISITING OTHER STATES OR COUNTRIES IN QUEST OF KNOWLEDGE
BOOKS ARE AN EVER READY AND COSTLESS VEHICLE
EMPIRICALLY
POSSIBLE AND IMITABLE
AND NOT WITH MOCK SHOWS AND COUNTERFEITS AND HEARSAYS
THE NOTORIOUS STEPHEN BURROUGHS
SEVERAL OF THE RUDIMENTAL STUDIES COULD BE INVESTED
AND WOULD STILL LEAVE IN THE TREASURY AN UNEXPENDED BALANCE OF TWENTY DOLLARS
I SAW SIX SCHOOLHOUSES ALL SITUATED ON THE SAME ROAD
WITH ONLY TWO OR THREE BRIEF RESPITES
TO CHECK THE FREE CIRCULATIONS IN THE SYSTEM ALL WHICH LEAD TO DWARFISHNESS
AND TO MISDIRECT THE ACTION OF THE VITAL ORGANS
THAT TO ENTRAP ON THE ONE SIDE AND ELUDE ON THE OTHER SOON BECOMES A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND COMPETITION BETWEEN TEACHER AND PUPILS
BOASTING OF MUTUAL CIRCUMVENTION AND DISINGENUOUSNESS
I HAVE OBTAINED THE OPINIONS OF SOME OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS AND PHYSIOLOGISTS IN THE STATE
OR A MISPRONOUNCED WORD
BY SUCH A PRACTICE A PUPIL FOREGOES ALL THE STOCK OF REAL KNOWLEDGE HE MIGHT OTHERWISE ACQUIRE
THIS FACT IS NOT NOW QUESTIONED BY ANY INTELLIGENT EDUCATIONIST
GIVING BOTH THE TEMPTATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMITTING EVERY SPECIES OF INDECORUM AND AGGRESSION
THERE WAS NOT ONE WHICH ADVOCATED THE INTRODUCTION OF SECTARIAN INSTRUCTION OR SECTARIAN BOOKS INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
GOOD SCHOOLHOUSES PREPARED
OR ABOUT TEN SEVENTEENTHS ONLY
ABOUT SEVEN SEVENTEENTHS
OR WHO KEEPS THEM AT HOME TO SUBSERVE THE PETTIEST CONVENIENCE
AND YET A SCHOOL AVERAGING FIFTY SCHOLARS
BUT HABITS OF INCORRECTNESS
OR MILITIA MUSTERS
IT IS THE PRACTICE OF MANY OF THE LYCEUMS IN THE STATE TO CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE LECTURE ROOM AT A GIVEN HOUR
IT IS A CELEBRATED SAYING OF THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER AND EDUCATIONIST
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE INFIX IN THE MIND A PERMANENT REPUGNANCE TO THE PLACE
THAT THE TENOR OF THE WHOLE MIGHT SEEM TOO CONDEMNATORY AND REPREHENSIVE
OR TO ANY CENTRAL AND SUPERVISORY BODY
BUT THE HEALTHINESS OF THEIR BODIES WILL BE EXPOSED TO CONTINUAL DANGER
THE EMPLOYMENT OF A BAD TEACHER WILL VITIATE THE WHOLE
ALTHOUGH HE MAY BE PERSONALLY CONVINCED OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OR PROFITABLENESS OF THEIR SERVICES
FROM NEVER HAVING SEEN MORE THAN THE FEEBLEST GLIMMERINGS OF THE LIGHT OF DAY
I HOLD THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ADDUCE FACTS AND ARGUMENTS
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF OUR MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS
WITH THE INCULCATION OF SOUND AND PRACTICAL MORALITY
THEY SEEM TO PROVE INCONTESTABLY THAT EDUCATION IS NOT ONLY A MORAL RENOVATOR
IT IS ABOVE THE REACH OF CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATION OR IN ADMINISTRATIONAL POLICY
BRUTE FORCE EXPENDS ITSELF UNPRODUCTIVELY
WHAT PROMINENCY AND COGENCY DO THEY GIVE TO THE ARGUMENT FOR OBEYING IT
IT WAS UNCOMMON FOR A GLAZIER'S APPRENTICE
SIMILAR ADVANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMPASS OF HUMAN LABOR AND RESEARCH
TO STEAMSHIPS WHICH BOLDLY TRAVERSE THE OCEAN
TO THOSE VAST CONDUITS WHICH SUPPLY THE DEMANDS OF A CITY
WHERE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF A SINGLE BOOK WAS THE LABOR OF MONTHS OR YEARS
THE SICK AND VALETUDINARY
WHICH IS ONE OF THE TEMPTERS TO CRIME
OR CIRCUMNAVIGATING A CONTINENT OF ICE AROUND THE SOUTH POLE
IT EXTINGUISHES LIFE WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY AND RAPIDITY
THE HASTIEST GLANCE AT THE CONDITION IN WHICH WE ARE PLACED IN THIS LIFE WILL DEMONSTRATE
OR INFLAMED BY ITS ARIDNESS
HENCE THEY ALLOW UNHEALTHFUL INDULGENCES
UNHEALTHFUL OCCUPATIONS ARE PURSUED
NO SMELTER LIVES IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF CORROSIVE GASES
NO PREPARER OF BEVERAGES INHALES THE CARBONIC ACID WHICH IS EVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF FERMENTATION
THERE ARE TEN PROFESSORS OF PUGILISM IN OUR COMMUNITY TO ONE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN OUR SEMINARIES OF LEARNING
THAT THIS BESTOWMENT MARKS THE EXTENT OR LIMIT OF ABILITY
OR REDUPLICATION
ARE ASCRIBABLE TO VIOLATIONS OF THE NATURAL LAWS OF LIFE AND HEALTH
CONSUMPTION AND INFLAMMATIONS
AND THEIR CONVERTIBILITY TO SUCH SHAPES OR COMBINATIONS AS OUR BODIES MAY REQUIRE
THEY SWALLOW CRUDITIES
HENCE ARISES QUACKERY
UNHEALTHFUL HABITS ARE FORMED
IN THE CASE OF THE JUGGLER
AND ISSUES FORTH FROM IT INTO THE AORTA IN ONE GREAT STREAM
PHYSIOLOGISTS ENUMERATE MORE THAN TWENTY OF THE ELEMENTARY OR COMPOUND TISSUES OF WHICH THE BODY IS COMPOSED
IRON AND THE OXYGEN THAT CORRODES IT
AFTER EACH OF THE VITAL POWERS HAS EXPENDED ITS QUANTUM OF FORCE
THERE IS NO SURVIVORSHIP
IN SUCH CASES WE UNGRATEFULLY AND IMPIOUSLY ATTRIBUTE THE EVENT TO THE INTERFERENCE OF OUR HEAVENLY FATHER
IT IS EFFUSED OR EXUDED FROM THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OR INNER COAT OF THE STOMACH
OR OF ANY CHEMICAL SOLVENTS
AND SOME PHYSIOLOGISTS ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE QUANTITY OF GASTRIC JUICE POURED INTO THIS ORGAN AT A HEARTY MEAL IS ONE PINT
I WILL ADD BUT ONE MORE REASON WHY ALL OUR FOOD SHOULD BE MASTICATED UNTIL IT IS GROUND TO A POWDER
AS UNSEEMLY AS IT IS UNHEALTHFUL
AS THOUGH THE PROCESSES OF NATURE COULD BE EXPEDITED BY THEIR IMPATIENCE OF DELAY
DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CIRCULATIONS
IS THE NECESSITY OF PURE AIR TO VITALIZE THE BLOOD AND SUSTAIN THE LIFE OF MAN
THEN THE BLOOD FLOWS BACK REJOICINGLY TO EVERY PART OF THE BODY
UNCOMPOUNDED BODY
SOME PHYSIOLOGISTS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM THIS AUTHORITY IN REGARD TO THE PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID IN THE AIR
WE APPLY A SHEET IRON BLOWER TO A GRATE
WE SEND OUR CHILDREN TO INHALE DISEASE IN UNVENTILATED SCHOOLHOUSES
ABSTRACTING THEIR HEAT AND IMPARTING ITS OWN COLD
BY THE STIMULUS OF PURE UNDILUTED OXYGEN
AMPLE PROVISION IS MADE FOR THE RECONVERSION OF THE CARBONIC ACID INTO CARBON AND OXYGEN
AND EJECTING A STREAM OF THE FORMER
THIS SPONGINESS OF STRUCTURE RESULTS FROM THE FACT
THROUGH THESE PORES A GREAT DEAL OF THE WASTE MATTER OF THE SYSTEM IS EXCRETED OR DISCHARGED
THE HEAT OF THE BODY VAPORIZES THE WATERY PART OF THE PERSPIRATION
THE DUE VITALIZATION OF THE BLOOD IN THE LUNGS
THE CARVING AND GROOVING OF ALL THE BONES AND JOINTS
THE CHANNELLING OUT OF THE BLOOD VESSELS
OXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD
THE PROPER OXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD
BUT AS PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT OR DISREGARDFUL OF THE LAWS OF NATURE
DIFFERENT RACES OF ANIMALS EXHIBIT TO OUR DAILY OBSERVATION THE CONSEQUENCES OF A MORE OR LESS PERFECT OXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD
IN THE SAME RATIO MUST THE OXYGENATION OF THAT FLUID BE REDUCED
NOR THEIR COUNTRYMEN'S IDOLATRY OF GENIUS
AS IT ALTERNATELY RECEIVES AND EJECTS THE VITAL STREAM
IF PERMITTED TO FULFIL THE WISE ORDINATIONS OF NATURE
AND THIS CHOKES AND INFLAMES THEIR MINUTE CHANNELS AS THEY BEAR IT ONWARD LABORIOUSLY TO THE BLOOD
OF CONSTRICTING THE BLOOD VESSELS BY PRESSURE UPON THE SURFACE
WITHOUT EXERCISE HIS BLOOD WILL BE BUT HALF OXYGENATED
THIS SHEATH IS ALWAYS SO WELL LUBRICATED
WE MAY FORM SOME CONCEPTION IN LOOKING AT A JUGGLER'S ARMS OR A MUSICIAN'S FINGERS
THAT FEEBLE AND SHALLOW BREATHING VENTILATES ONLY THE UPPER PART OF THE LUNGS
ON THE DUE OXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD
THESE FACTS HAVE THE GREATEST PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCY
AND A DEFICIENT OXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD
OR THINKING IT UNGENTEEL TO PRACTISE VIGOROUS EXERCISES
IT WOULD PUT AN END TO AN OTHERWISE ENDLESS AMOUNT OF QUACKERY
AND WHAT A DISSUASIVE AGAINST BRINGING INTO CONTACT WITH THE DELICATE COATS OF THE STOMACH AS THE IGNORANT SO OFTEN DO THOSE FIERY COMPOUNDS OF FOOD OR BEVERAGE
WOULD ACTUALLY BLISTER AND EXCORIATE THEM
NEVER DID THE CREW OF A FOUNDERING VESSEL SHRIEK LOUDER FOR HELP THAN THE BRAIN CRIES OUT FOR RELIEF UNDER SUCH INFLICTIONS
AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF HEALTH AND LIFE MAY BE AND MUST BE POPULARIZED
OR ONE DOLLAR'S WORTH OF PROPERTY
AND THE COMMON SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY RATIFIES THEIR OPINION
DURING THE PAST YEAR I HAVE COLLECTED SOME INTERESTING STATISTICS RESPECTING THE SCHOOLHOUSES IN THE COMMONWEALTH
OF THE REPORT ON SCHOOLHOUSES
FOR THE ERECTION AND PERMANENT REPAIRS OF SCHOOLHOUSES
HENCE ALL THE AGGREGATES ARE LESS THAN THEY SHOULD BE
FORFEITS ITS DISTRIBUTIVE SHARE OF THE INCOME OF THE SCHOOL FUND
WE MAY YET ESCAPE THE MAGNITUDE AND FORMIDABLENESS OF THOSE CALAMITIES UNDER WHICH SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE NOW SUFFERING
AND OF THE POSITIONS INTO WHICH ALL THE VOCAL ORGANS MUST BE BROUGHT IN ORDER TO ENUNCIATE THEM
AND LEADS HIM TO ENUNCIATE SOUNDS UNTIL THE VIBRATIONS PRODUCED IN HIS OWN THROAT RESEMBLE THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY THE UTTERANCE OF THE TEACHER
AND THEN ENUNCIATE SUCCESSIVELY THE SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS A AND E
ALMOST ALL THE VOCAL ORGANS ARE CHANGED FROM THE POSITION WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR ENUNCIATING THE LETTER A
DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM A DEFICIENCY OR MALFORMATION OF THE ORGANS THEMSELVES
I SAW MANY SCHOOLHOUSES
IT WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE OF INCOMPUTABLE GOOD
THESE VIOLATORS OF THE LAW
THE MONITORIAL SYSTEM WHERE GREAT NUMBERS MUST BE TAUGHT AT A SMALL EXPENSE MAY ACCOMPLISH NO INCONSIDERABLE GOOD
THIS LEADS TO AN EXPLANATION OF SUCH WORDS AS CIRCUMSPECT CIRCUMVENT CIRCUMJACENT
CIRCUMFERENCE CIRCUMFLEX
THE ADMIRABLE REPORT OF PROFESSOR STOWE
ONLY WHEN NECESSARY FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING UNITY AND INTELLIGIBLENESS TO MY OWN REMARKS
THIS CAUTIONARY STATEMENT IS NECESSARY
SO MANY CRIMINAL CASES WERE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM FOR ADJUDICATION
I HAVE BEFORE ADVERTED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCHOOLHOUSES
IN PROFESSOR STOWE'S EXCELLENT REPORT
I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A CHILD IN THE ROOM WHO KNEW OR THOUGHT THAT HIS PLAYTIME HAD COME
BUT THE ONE NO MORE THAN THE OTHER IS THE UNBOUGHT GIFT OF NATURE
AND THEN OF REMANDING HIM TO HIS SEAT TO SIT STILL AND LOOK AT VACANCY
SO THAT NO ONE OF THEM EVER TIRES OR IS CLOYED
THAT OF MISMATCHING THEIR WORDS AND IDEAS
OR OF FORCING A PYGMY'S DRESS UPON THE HUGE LIMBS OF A GIANT
THE POWER OF RECOGNIZING ANALOGIES AND DISSIMILARITIES
THE MORE CERTAIN WILL HE BE TO MISCALL THEM IN WORDS
AND SOMETIMES SUFFIXED
SUCH A SCALE COULD HARDLY BE CROWDED INTO AN OCTAVO PAGE
WITH US IT IS KNOWN BY THE NAME PHONIC
AND A RECOMBINATION OF THE SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS MAKES THE SOUND OF THE WORD
AND INSTRUCTIVENESS
THE SIMPLE NUMBERS WERE HANDLED AND TRANSPOSED IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS
AND HE SETS DOWN FIVE IN THE UNIT'S PLACE
TO PASS UNREPEATED
PROFESSOR STOWE GIVES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THE MANNER OF TEACHING AND EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF SPEECH
THEIR DIFFERENCES AND PECULIARITIES ARE PROPORTIONALLY LARGER
THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT BECOMES A QUICKENER TO DEVOTION
THE TEACHER ACCELERATES OR RETARDS HIS UTTERANCE ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF FACILITY THE CLASS HAS ACQUIRED
MISTER CARL RITTER OF BERLIN PROBABLY THE GREATEST GEOGRAPHER NOW LIVING EXPRESSED A DECIDED OPINION TO ME
A DOZEN CRINKLING STROKES
WHICH AT ONCE DISPARAGES SCIENCE
THE TEACHING OF THE HIGHER BRANCHES FALLS INTO DISREPUTE IN THE MINDS OF ALL SENSIBLE MEN
ONLY IN ACCUMULATED WEARISOMENESS AND MONOTONY
WHICH PROFESSOR STOWE HAS OMITTED TO MENTION
AS PROFESSOR STOWE SAYS
THIS IS A QUESTION WHICH CAN BE ANSWERED ONLY BY GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEMINARIES FOR TEACHERS FROM THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY OR EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
TO MENTION THE NUMBER OF THESE SEMINARIES FOR TEACHERS
AS THERE ARE SEMINARIES SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY
THE STATED TERM OF RESIDENCE AT THESE SEMINARIES IS THREE YEARS
ENVIRON THIS SACRED CALLING
CONNECTED WITH ALL THE SEMINARIES FOR TEACHERS ARE LARGE MODEL OR EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOLS
WHILE THEY HAVE LESS OF SANCTIMONIOUSNESS AND AUSTERITY
I PREFERRED TO ENTER AS A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL AND UNCOMMENDED VISITOR
HE GESTICULATES LIKE AN ORATOR
I HAVE SEEN THE CHILDREN WROUGHT UP TO AN EXCITEMENT PROPORTIONALLY INTENSE
BUT INSTEAD OF STANDING AND EXTEMPORIZING
HABITUATES AND HARDENS THE PUPILS TO BLUNDERING AND UNCERTAINTY
DISPARAGES THE VALUE OF CORRECTNESS IN THEIR EYES
ARE THE NATURAL AND LEGITIMATE RESULT OF THEIR SEMINARIES FOR TEACHERS
A NORMAL SCHOOL ESTABLISHED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THAT ENLIGHTENED EDUCATIONIST
SAYS PROFESSOR STOWE
DISALLOWS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FREE NORMAL SCHOOL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ITS PEOPLE
AND CHARACTER ARE DEEMED ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITES
IF EXAMINERS
AND A SUCCESSION OF IGNORANT AND INCOMPETENT CANDIDATES WILL BE SURE TO APPLY FOR SCHOOLS IN TOWNS WHICH HAVE IGNORANT EXAMINERS
THEIR BEST STUDENTS WOULD EXCOGITATE MORE PHILOSOPHICALLY BY DAY IF THEY KNEW ENOUGH TO SLEEP MORE PHYSIOLOGICALLY AT NIGHT
HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE USE OF EXAMINERS AND VISITORS
DRAWING CALLIGRAPHY AND SINGING IN ALL THIRTEEN BRANCHES
OF OUR DEBATING CLUBS AND LYCEUMS
WHY THE PEOPLE ARE SO SLUGGISH AND UNENTERPRISING IN THEIR CHARACTER
NOT EVEN UNDER THE JEWISH THEOCRACY
AND POLLUTES THE BLOOD OF GENERATIONS YET UNBORN
THE COARSE PENNY PRINTS OF THE ILLUMINATED AND VOLUPTUOUS ORIGINALS OF KINGLY AND COURTLY SENSUALISM
HE CAN LIBERALIZE THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE
WHETHER THE CAUSE OF SCHOOL MORALS WOULD GAIN MORE IN THE END BY A CLOSENESS OF INSPECTION DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OUTFLOW OF ALL NATURAL ACTION
AND ALL THE PRECEPTIVE PARTS OF THE GOSPEL
THE FORM OF THE ORDINARY'S LICENSE IS AS FOLLOWS
AND THE MEANING OF THE PRECEPTIVE PARTS OF THE GOSPEL
AS IT WOULD BE UNINSTRUCTIVE ON SUCH A SUBJECT TO TAKE SPECIMENS FROM THOSE OF A LOW GRADE
SELECTING VERSES WHOSE DIVISION WAS SUCH THAT EACH CLAUSE PRESENTED A SUBSTANTIVE IDEA
AND A DISBELIEVER IN THE DIVINE AUTHORITY OF THE BOOK
AND THE INCULCATION OF WHOSE DOCTRINES AS HELD BY THE STATE
THE INCOMPUTABLE WEALTH THAT FLOWS FROM THE BOUNTY OF HEAVEN DURING THE REVOLVING SEASONS OF THE YEAR
IT HAS TAKEN AGES AND CENTURIES OF WRONGS TO BEND THE BODY INTO ABJECTNESS
THERE IS A MORAL AND A PHYSICAL ENTAILMENT AS WELL AS A CIVIL
AND TOO CAUTIOUS ABOUT CONTRACTING THOSE MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCES WHICH THEY CANNOT REPUTABLY AND COMFORTABLY SUSTAIN
A PAUPER ENGENDERING HIVE
INTERDICTING THEIR ACCESS TO HEAVEN
EVILS WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIKE UNMERITORIOUS TO AVOID AND UNPARDONABLE TO PERMIT
IT IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR US TO ADDUCE THE VAST
AND YET NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THE WANT OF A CORRESPONDING ACTION ON THIS SUBJECT STILL BECLOUDS THE PROSPECTS OF THE SCHOOLS
AND HAVE HAD THEIR DWARFISHNESS EXPANDED INTO LUXURIANCE
AND THEIR BITTER AND SOMETIMES POISONOUS QUALITIES AMELIORATED INTO RICHNESS OF FLAVOR AND NUTRITION
AND THEN THEY HAVE INVOKED THE AID OF HEAVEN TO SUBDUE THAT FEROCIOUSNESS OF THE PASSIONS WHICH EVEN A WORLDLY FORESIGHT WOULD HAVE CHECKED
AND OUR DEPOSITORIES OF SILVER AND GOLD
THE ABILITY TO MAKE LONG MARCHES UNFATIGUED
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CONSTITUENCIES
OF SCHOOL MOTIVES AND OF SOME MEANS FOR AVOIDING AND EXTIRPATING SCHOOL VICES
PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF THE CASE CONDUCING TO A RESULT SO LAMENTABLE
SUPPOSE A RECIPROCATION OF KIND OFFICES AMONG SCHOOLMATES HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR ALIENATION OR HOSTILITY
THE TEACHER CAN NEITHER TRANSFUSE KNOWLEDGE BY ANY PROCESS OF DECANTING
IF INSTEAD OF ARROGATING SOVEREIGNTY TO HIS OWN PERSONAL WILL
DOES NOT THE APOSTLE SAY THAT THE GOODNESS OF GOD LEADETH US TO REPENTANCE
THE DIFFERENCE IS UNIMAGINABLY GREAT BETWEEN LEADING AND DRIVING
THE CASES OF INSURGENCY AGAINST HIM WILL BE RARE
IF THE TEACHER'S MIND CANNOT OVERMASTER THE PUPIL'S MIND IN ITS THEN PRESENT CONDITION
IF THEY ARE UNOBSERVANT IN WHAT PART OF THE ROOM HE STANDS
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ARISES AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OR INEXPEDIENCY OF PROMULGATING A CODE OF LAWS FOR ITS GOVERNMENT
AND THIS HE CAN DO BY A GRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF SOME IMMORAL GREAT MAN
UNTIL THEY HAVE BECOME MORALLY ACCLIMATED TO OUR INSTITUTIONS
WHICH OVERLAYS ALL
HE IS TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF IT BY RECTIFYING THAT STATE OF MIND OUT OF WHICH VIOLATIONS COME
IN ORDER TO PREVENT HIS CONTAMINATIONS AT HOME
INTO INCORRIGIBLENESS AND MISANTHROPY
IT MAY BE RESTORED TO SOUNDNESS AND DOCILITY BY REPROOFS OR CHASTISEMENTS ADMINISTERED IN WISDOM AND LOVE
THE PUPILS MAY BE TRANSPOSED
AS THE WRONGFUL ACT WHICH IS COMMITTED
IT ALSO DISQUALIFIES THE PUPIL MORE AND MORE FOR MASTERING SUBSEQUENT LESSONS
AND FOR A LONG TIME HE MOVES FEEBLY AND TOTTERINGLY FORWARD
WHY SHOULD WE DOUBT THAT THE LITTLE TRICKS AND PREVARICATIONS OF THE SCHOOLROOM MAY GROW UP INTO FRAUDULENT BANKRUPTCIES
OR STUPENDOUS PECULATIONS AND EMBEZZLEMENTS
IF THE GROCER ADULTERATES HIS SUGAR AND HIS FLOUR TO THE AMOUNT OF TEN PER CENT OF ITS VALUE
TO DETERMINE THE CORRECTNESS OR INCORRECTNESS OF THE ANSWERS AS THEY SHOULD BE FOUND BY THE PUPIL
AS TO THE RUDIMENTAL PARTS
IF NOT FORTY NINE FIFTIETHS
IT OBVIOUSLY TEMPTS TO CONCEALMENT WHICH IS UNFAITHFULNESS
PROBABLY THE FIEND WHO TEMPTS TO CRIME BY THE HOPE OR PROMISE OF CONCEALMENT OUTNUMBERS ALL HIS FELLOW FIENDS IN THE RETINUE OF HIS VICTIMS
IT IS THE EYE OF SENSE ONLY WHICH MAGNIFIES THE NEAR
BUT IT IS OCULARLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF OUR NATURE
SPREAD AT THE TRUE FOCAL DISTANCE OVER ITS INTERIOR SURFACE
LYING AT INCOMPUTABLE DISTANCES FROM OUR SYSTEM
THE COMBUSTIBILITY OF WOOD
BUT WHAT PROFIT CAN THE COLD UTILITARIAN EXTORT FROM ALL THE VARIEGATION AND CHANGEFUL BEAUTIES OF COLOR
LIKE OTHER COUNTERFEITERS
RATHER THAN CONNIVES AT
THERE SHOULD BE NO ARTS TO ENTRAP ON HIS SIDE
AND DISPEL THE OMINOUS DOUBTINGS WHICH IT SUGGESTS
WHAT EXPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE INHERENT DETESTABLENESS OF PROFANENESS AND OBSCENITY AND FALSEHOOD
THERE IS ANOTHER FACT WHICH DEEPENS AND AGGRAVATES
THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT THE LEARNER'S MIND SHOULD BE CONDUCTED THROUGH ALL THE INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF PROGRESS
AND THEN SUBMITS THE WHOLE TO THE LEARNER'S INTELLIGENCE
AND THE DEPOSITORIES
WHOSE MUNIFICENCE IN THE BESTOWMENT OF HIS FACULTIES
THE UNEXPECTED LENGTH TO WHICH THIS REPORT HAS ALREADY EXTENDED ADMONISHES ME TO BRING IT TO A CLOSE
IS A SUBJECT HERETOFORE UNINVESTIGATED
ANY MORE THAN IN THE DAYS OF THE JEWISH THEOCRACY
HAVING REVIVIFIED HER SPIRIT BY THE GENIUS OF CHRISTIANITY
THE RESOLVES PROVIDE ONLY FOR THE REPUBLICATION OF SO MUCH OF HIS THE LATE SECRETARY'S TENTH ANNUAL REPORT
OWING TO THE SPARSENESS OF THEIR POPULATION AND THE SCANTINESS OF THEIR RESOURCES
AND EVERY TOWN CONTAINING ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES OR HOUSEHOLDERS WAS REQUIRED TO SET UP A GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHOSE MASTER SHOULD BE ABLE TO INSTRUCT YOUTH SO FAR AS THEY MAY BE FITTED FOR THE UNIVERSITY
BUT DEFRAUDERS AND PLUNDERERS OF THE MEANS OF OTHERS
AS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE CIVIL FUNCTIONS OF A WITNESS OR A JUROR
THE COMPLAINERS ARE THE WRONG DOERS
AND OFFER THEMSELVES AS AN UNCHARTERED MEDIUM FOR INTERCHANGING THE PRODUCTS OF ALL THE ZONES
UNASKED AND UNTHANKED FOR
HAS ANY SUCH TITLE TO OR OWNERSHIP IN THESE INGREDIENTS AND SUBSTANTIALS OF ALL WEALTH
THERE IS ONE SUPPOSABLE CASE
THE OBJECTOR CAN NO LONGER SHRINK INTO HIS INDIVIDUALITY
MORE THAN THEY COULD PERAMBULATE AND SURVEY
IT IS NOT AT ALL IN CONTRAVENTION OF THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT THAT THE ADULT PORTION OF SOCIETY DOES TAKE
THEY WHO REFUSE TO TRAIN UP CHILDREN IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD GO ARE TRAINING UP INCENDIARIES AND MADMEN TO DESTROY PROPERTY AND LIFE
IF THE MIND IS AS REAL AND SUBSTANTIVE A PART OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AS THE BODY
EVERY STATE IS MORALLY BOUND TO ENACT A CODE OF LAWS LEGALIZING AND ENFORCING INFANTICIDE
AND ALL SEMINARIES OF THEM
SHE FOUNDS AND SUPPORTS HOSPITALS FOR RESTORING REASON TO THE INSANE
EVEN FOR THOSE VIOLATORS OF THE LAW WHOM SHE IS OBLIGED TO SEQUESTRATE FROM SOCIETY
IN HER RIGHTEOUS CODE THE INTERCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE IS A CRIME
SHE EXPLORES THE WORLD FOR NEW OBJECTS OF BENEFICENCE
SHE SUBDUES NOTHING
THAT EXTINGUISHES A LIGHT AND SAVES A HOUSE
AND REACHES IT BY THE DIRECT ROUTE OF AN HOUR INSTEAD OF THE CIRCUITOUS GROPINGS OF A DAY
AND PRONOUNCES THE SAME SUBLIME FIAT
THEIR MEASURES OF COUNTERACTION ARE NOT THE LESS EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY ARE INDIRECT
TO A MILLENNIAL GOAL
BECAUSE OF THE ONE OR TWO MILLS UPON THE DOLLAR WHICH ITS SUPPORT SUBTRACTS FROM THEIR PROPERTY
TO MEET THE OPPOSITION AND THE INDIFFERENCE ORIGINATING IN THESE AND SIMILAR PREJUDGMENTS
TO BE HERE UNDERSTOOD AS NOT INCLUDING IN THIS MOIETY OF UNNECESSARY SUFFERING AND OF UNTIMELY DEATH A SINGLE ONE OF THAT EXTENSIVE CLASS OF CASES WHICH RESULT FROM A SLAVISH SUBMISSION TO SOME TYRANNOUS APPETITE
THE INDISPENSABLENESS OF EDUCATION TO WORLDLY PROSPERITY HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED
CERTAIN SPECIFIC EMENDATIONS OF OUR PRESENT SCHOOL SYSTEM
ONLY SUCH EMENDATIONS
BUT THE COMMON SENTIMENTS OF MANKIND WOULD REVOLT AT ANY PROPOSAL TO PREVENT ALL VIOLATIONS OF THE MORAL CODE BY EXTINGUISHING THE LIFE OF THE VIOLATORS
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE IGNORANCE OR CREDULITY OF THE PURCHASER TO OBTAIN A PRICE WHICH HE KNOWS TO BE EXORBITANT AND INEQUITABLE
UNEXPLAINED AND UNATONED FOR
DETHRONING SELFISHNESS
A CAPITALIST WILL NOT AID A NEW ENTERPRISE WITH HIS MONEY UNTIL HE IS SATISFIED OF THE PROFITABLENESS OF THE INVESTMENT
NOTHING WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE CAN BE GUILTLESSLY OMITTED
IN NOTHING WHICH I HAVE ADVANCED HAS IT BEEN MY INTENTION TO ADVOCATE ANY SECTARIAN INSTRUCTION IN OUR SCHOOLS
WHICH ANY BELIEVER IN THE BIBLE WOULD REASONABLY DEEM TO BE SECTARIAN
TO DESTROY IT TO DOUBT IT WOULD BE THE MORAL UNHINGEMENT OF SOCIETY
I HAVE DESIRED IN THE PRESENT CASE TO INTRODUCE TESTIMONY OF SUCH CREDIBILITY AND COGENCY
IT ADDS GREAT COGENCY TO THEIR TESTIMONY
CAN SEND OUT REDEEMING AND TRANSFORMING INFLUENCES WHICH SHALL EXPEL NINETY NINE HUNDREDTHS OF ALL THE VICES AND CRIMES UNDER WHICH SOCIETY NOW MOURNS AND AGONIZES
BUT PERSEVERANCE ON THE PART OF THE FRIENDS OF PROGRESS ALWAYS SUBDUES IT
AS A PRETEXT FOR TURNING THE SCHOOLS INTO PROSELYTIZING INSTITUTIONS
THE LAW REARS A BARRIER AGAINST ALL SECTARIAN ENCROACHMENTS
NATURE OFTEN PREDETERMINES WHAT A MAN SHALL DO
BUT TO OUR UNPARDONABLE NIGGARDLINESS IN NOT CULTIVATING AND EMPLOYING THEM
AND WHAT OF THOSE ENORMOUS PECULATIONS BY GOVERNMENT DEFAULTERS
OF BUILDING HOUSES OF CORRECTION AND JAILS AND PENITENTIARIES FOR RESTRAINING AND PUNISHING THEM
INSTEAD OF SUBTRACTING FROM IT
COULD WE CONVERT INTO COWORKERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND ALL THOSE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL POWERS OF USEFULNESS WHICH ARE NOW ANTAGONISTS OR NEUTRALS
OR EVEN OF THE CURABLE CLASSES IN IT
DEFILEMENTS WHICH THE BAPTISM OF A MORAL AND CHRISTIAN EDUCATION ALONE CAN REMOVE
AVERAGED UPON ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT THEIR FORMIDABLENESS WILL WHOLLY DISAPPEAR IF SUBJECTED TO A CANDID EXAMINATION
WHERE THE PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO REIMBURSE THE COST
AND WHO WILL BE INDUCED TO LEND THEIR SERVICES IN AID OF GREAT SOCIAL AMELIORATIONS ONLY WHEN THEY FIND THAT HUMANITY IS ECONOMY
ON THE PLEA OF NON REMUNERATING RETURNS
AND BY INSTILLING INTO HIS MIND THE PRINCIPLES
BY WHICH HE SHALL BE TWICE BOUND OR DOUBLY FASTENED FOR SUCH IS THE ETYMOLOGICAL MEANING OF THE WORD RELIGION TO PERFORM
BUT ITS COGENCY IS RAISED TO A MATHEMATICAL POWER EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF THE WITNESSES
THAT UNIVERSALITY OF EDUCATION EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE IS A SUBSTANTIVE PART OF THE PLAN HERE PROPOSED
IT INVOKES THAT SELFISHNESS TO DO GOOD TO OTHERS FOR THE REFLECTED BENEFITS UPON ITSELF
AND WOULD THUS LEAVE BUT FEW OF THOSE UNNATURAL CASES OF THOSE PARENTS WHO ARE NOT PARENTS TO BE DEALT WITH COMPULSIVELY
AND OVERRULES ALL THEIR EFFORTS
AND THE MISERIES AND DEGRADATIONS INCIDENT TO INDIGENCE
THE PRESENT CONDITION OF IRELAND CANCELS ALL THE GLORIES OF THE BRITISH CROWN
AND NERVES TO AGONIZE
NOT BY THEIR EXPATRIATION
OUR EXEMPLARS
ARE WE NOT IN DANGER OF NATURALIZING AND DOMESTICATING AMONG OURSELVES THOSE HIDEOUS EVILS WHICH ARE ALWAYS ENGENDERED BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR
IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER OF THE CONDITIONS OF MEN
AGRARIANISM IS THE REVENGE OF POVERTY AGAINST WEALTH
THE DEMOLITION OF MACHINERY BECAUSE IT SUPERSEDES HAND LABOR
OR REVOLUTIONIZERS
ARE OPERATED BY THE ENERGIES AND THE VELOCITIES OF NATURE
UNLIKE ROBBERY OR SLAVERY OR AGRARIANISM
WHY THERE WAS THIS PREPOSTEROUSNESS
ITS GREATER PROFITABLENESS WILL NOT REDOUND TO HIS BENEFIT
AND GROOVING THEM TOGETHER
AFFIXES IRON WHEELS
IS A MORAL PHASE OF THE PROBLEM OF THE ASYMPTOTE
AND VARIEGATION OF VEGETABLE GROWTHS
THIS LAW OF ASSIMILATION BETWEEN THE CHOOSERS AND THE CHOSEN RESULTS
AND CANKERS THE MORALS OF ENTIRE CLASSES OF THE PEOPLE
THE LICENSING OF HOUSES FOR THE SALE OF INTOXICATING DRINKS
STANDS EVEN ON A MORE UNSOUND AND CRIMINAL FOOTING THAN LEGALIZING THE PEST OF LOTTERIES
HAVE EXHIBITED HATEFUL SPECIMENS OF THE OTHER KINDS OF THESE INCARNATIONS OF EVIL
THAT EVEN THE LOWEST INSTINCTS OF SELF INTEREST WILL VISIT THE FALSIFIER WITH RETRIBUTION
HE CANNOT CERTAINLY DETERMINE THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT TO WHICH HE DEPOSES
ANY MORE THAN A GOOD SURGEON WOULD AMPUTATE A LIMB
TO DISCUSS THE DISPUTABLE QUESTIONS
AFTER PETTY SKIRMISHINGS AMONG NEIGHBORS
THE FIERCE ENCOUNTER WILL BEGIN IN THE DISTRICT'S PRIMARY ASSEMBLY
IF PARENTS FIND THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE INDOCTRINATED INTO WHAT THEY CALL POLITICAL HERESIES
IT WILL COME TO BE UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT POLITICAL PROSELYTISM IS NO FUNCTION OF THE SCHOOL
BUT THAT INDOCTRINATION INTO MATTERS OF CONTROVERSY BETWEEN HOSTILE POLITICAL PARTIES IS TO BE ELSEWHERE SOUGHT FOR
BUT UNPRINCIPLED MEN PANDER TO DEPRAVED APPETITES
CRIME ADULTERATES IT
THEY HAVE TRIED DRACONIAN CODES OF LAW
AND NOT UPON THE FLEXIBLENESS AND DUCTILITY OF YOUTHFUL TENDENCIES
THAT THOUGH A GIANT'S ARM CANNOT BEND A TREE OF A CENTURY'S GROWTH
SHOW THE DISTILLER HOW HE CHANGES THE LIFE SUSTAINING FRUITS OF THE EARTH INTO A PHYSICAL AND MORAL POISON
A CONDITION THAT BALKS DESIRE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN IT IS MOST CRAVING
UNCHASTENED BY TEMPERANCE
AMONGST A PEOPLE SO COMMENDABLY SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION AS ARE THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS
AND THAT A RIVAL SYSTEM OF PAROCHIAL OR SECTARIAN SCHOOLS IS NOW URGED UPON THE PUBLIC BY A NUMEROUS
OR BY POSITIVE INFLICTIONS
IF THE NON CONFORMIST FEELS HIMSELF
THAN THAT ERRORS SO FATAL SHOULD GO UNABOLISHED
THE DEED OF MERCY COMMEMORATED BY THIS PICTURE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE APPROPRIATE EMBLEM OF THE INQUISITOR'S WORK
PROHIBITING SECTARIAN INSTRUCTION IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
BUT TO BE IN PLAIN CONTRAVENTION OF LAW
I BELIEVED THAT SECTARIAN BOOKS AND SECTARIAN INSTRUCTION
TO MY SUGGESTION IN REGARD TO VINDICATORY MEASURES
AFTER SUFFERING UNDER MISCONSTRUCTIONS OF CONDUCT
OFFICIALLY AND UNOFFICIALLY
THAT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES IS ADMITTED
IT FOUNDS ITS MORALS ON THE BASIS OF RELIGION
IF HIS CHILDREN CAN BE COMPULSORILY TAKEN
IT HAD BEEN USED FOR SECTARIAN PURPOSES
SHOULD INSIST UPON SATURATING THE AIR WITH THE PRODUCTS OF HIS OWN DISTILLATIONS
TO MISCONSTRUE AND OVERRIDE IT
FROM ATHEISM TO THUGGERY
AND SEEKS TO IMPRINT UPON THE IGNORANCE AND RECEPTIVENESS OF CHILDHOOD THE CONVICTIONS WHICH IT COULD NEVER FASTEN UPON THE MINDS OF MEN IN THEIR MATURITY
CONCRETED INTO ONE
BUT EVERY PAGE IN THE HISTORY OF POLEMIC STRUGGLES SHOWS SUCH A SUPPOSITION TO BE DELUSIVE
AFFINITIES AND REPULSIONS WOULD GATHER MEN INTO BODIES
ONE OTHER SYSTEM IF IT MAY BE SO CALLED IS SUPPOSABLE
THE PAROCHIAL OR SECTARIAN SYSTEM MIGHT EFFECT SOMETHING IN POPULOUS PLACES
SURELY THE VERY STATEMENT OF THE CASE SUPERSEDES ARGUMENT IN REGARD TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MAINTAINING SCHOOLS FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE CHILDREN OF THE COUNTRY ON SUCH A BASIS
AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF PRIVATE AND SECTARIAN SCHOOLS IN THEIR STEAD
THE VOLUNTARY AND SECTARIAN SYSTEM LEAVES AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND MANUFACTURING CLASSES IN A STATE OF THE MOST DEPLORABLE IGNORANCE
THAT IT IS A SYSTEM WHICH INVOKES A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
CHARLES' AFFECTION FOR HIS WIFE
AND CHARLES HENRY SALTER
JEREMIAH'S HEALTH HAD BEEN VERY TREACHEROUS
SUCH AN INSTANCE IS FOUND IN THE CASE OF MATILDA MAHONEY IN BALTIMORE
IN ANSWER TO AN ADVISORY LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMITTEE THE FOLLOWING FROM THE DOCTOR IS EXPLICIT
WILLIAM HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO DIG AND DELVE
CHARLES AND JOHN WERE OWNED BY JAMES HODGES
QUICKLY CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF UNHITCHING AND ATTEMPTING FURTHER PURSUIT ON HORSEBACK
WHO LIVED AT WILLIAMSBURG
AND BY TRADE WAS A PRACTICAL CORKER
ALIAS JOHNSON HENSON THIS SUBJECT WAS UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF A CERTAIN JOHN ERNIE
MISTER ERNIE HAD ONLY BEEN IN POSSESSION OF THE WAYWARD ALEXANDER THREE WEEKS
BY THE NAME OF ADAM QUIGLEY
HE DECLARED THAT QUIGLEY WAS A VERY MEAN MAN ONE FOR WHOM HE HAD NO RESPECT WHATEVER
HOW TO MEET THE DANGER WAS TO CHARLES' MIND AT FIRST VERY PUZZLING
HE WAS THEN SENT TO MACON AND THENCE TO THE COTTON PLANTATION AGAIN
IN JULY EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE HE WAS TAKEN TO AN INFIRMARY IN MACON
ON THE TWELFTH OF MARCH HE RAN AWAY FROM MACON AND WENT TO SAVANNAH
THE MARSHAL OF MACON CALLED AT THE JAIL IN NEWCASTLE
BUT HOLDS IT UNDER CURIA TILL AFTER THE SOMERSET COUNTY COURT

WITH SOME PERSONS THOSE AWES AND TERRORS OF YOUTH LAST FOR EVER AND EVER
SAID THIS YOUNG MISANTHROPIST
DID YOU EVER SEE A PAIR OF BUCKSKINS LIKE THOSE AT MISS PINKERTON'S CONTINUED HE
I HAVE ALLUDED TO HIS BUCKSKINS
SHE HAD BESIDES READ THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AND GUTHRIE'S GEOGRAPHY
THE EXPENSES OF HIS BOARD AND SCHOOLING WERE DEFRAYED BY HIS FATHER IN GOODS
GROCERS AND OILMEN
AND HIS TIGHT CORDUROYS
IT WAS THE LAD WHO HAD PEACHED UPON HIM ABOUT THE GROCER'S CART
IN REPLY TO THE FIRST PART OF CUFF'S SENTENCE
WHILE CUFF'S ASTONISHMENT WAS SCARCELY LESS
AS HIS OPPONENT DROPPED AS NEATLY ON THE GREEN AS I HAVE SEEN JACK SPOT'S BALL PLUMP INTO THE POCKET AT BILLIARDS
AND THAT WE WERE ALL BENT ON GOING OUT FOR A NIGHT'S PLEASURING
AND MUST BEG THE GOOD NATURED READER TO REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ONLY DISCOURSING AT PRESENT ABOUT A STOCKBROKER'S FAMILY IN RUSSELL SQUARE
AND HICCUPPED OUT BLESS YOU
WITH THE MUTENESS AND GRAVITY OF AN UNDERTAKER
A MOMENTARY SMILE FLICKERED OVER MISTER BRUSH'S FEATURES AS HE SPOKE
AND HE DID IT SO DROLLY THAT EMMY LAUGHED TOO
AND SHE'S SURE SHE'S PUT YOUR WHITE RIBBING INTO HER BOX
THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH IN ONE OF HER PROGRESSES
EACH WITH A HATCHMENT OVER THE MIDDLE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW
YOU SEE MISS SHARP WHEN I'M NOT HERE TINKER'S ON BOARD WAGES
AND PRESENTLY WE HEARD MISTER HODSON'S WHIP CRACKING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE POOR LITTLE BLUBBERING WRETCHES
HER STEPSON MISTER CRAWLEY WAS LIKEWISE IN THE ROOM
MUTTON'S MUTTON SAID THE BARONET AND A DEVILISH GOOD THING
IT'S NOT QUITE BUSTING
AS MOST BLONDES WILL
BUT BEYOND THIS NO OTHER LIKE OR DISLIKING
AND HAD THAT FAMOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE REVEREND SILAS HORNBLOWER
LORD SOUTHDOWN'S THIRD DAUGHTER
FROM UNDERFEEDING AND BUYING CHEAP
AN AUNT WITH A LOZENGE ON HER CARRIAGE
ADDING THAT IT WAS THE HISTORY OF MISTER HUMPHREY CLINKER
SHE COULD CLIMB A TREE TO ROB THE NESTS OF THE FEATHERED SONGSTERS OF THEIR SPECKLED SPOILS
SHE LIVES WITH ATHEISTS AND FRENCHMEN
ALL HIS OUTGOINGS AND INCOMINGS YOU KNOW
BEFORE BREAKFAST A WALK WITH SIR PITT AND HIS SPUD
WHOM SHE ABOMINATES
AN OLD CHAW BACON
AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF COURSE LASTED AS LONG AS THE JOVIAL OLD MEDIATRIX WAS THERE TO KEEP THE PEACE
IT KILLS ME WITH HEARTBURN
AND THAT METHODIST MILKSOP OF AN ELDEST SON LOOKS TO PARLIAMENT CONTINUED MISTER CRAWLEY
I'LL GO OVER TO HUDDLESTON
AND WHEN SIR HUDDLESTON HAD
THAT RELIGION WAS AT A VERY LOW EBB IN THE COUNTY OF HANTS
THE EARL OF BRUIN'S DAUGHTER AND HEIRESS
THE MOST DREARY AND SERIOUS OF FORENOONS
AND ABET HER IN SUCH IDOLATRY AND SILLY ROMANTIC IDEAS LOVED
OPINING THAT IT WAS A DUCHESS IN LONDON WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM
OR THAT IT WAS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT'S LADY
AND DON'T GIRLS LIKE A RAKE BETTER THAN A MILKSOP
HE LOVED HER MUCH TOO FONDLY TO SUBJECT HER TO THAT HORRID WOMAN AND HER VULGARITIES
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU MARRY HIGHER THAN A STOCKBROKER'S DAUGHTER
BUT HIS GODSON WAS MUCH TOO ELATED TO MARK THE WORTHY STOCKBROKER'S DEPRESSION
SHE HAS ONLY OVEREATEN HERSELF THAT IS ALL
AT THE FOOT OF HER PATRONESS'S BED
RELIGIONLESS OLD WOMAN
AND MISS REBECCA SHARP STILL REMAINING AT HER PATRONESS'S HOUSE IN PARK LANE
ONE MORE HATCHMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN GREAT GAUNT STREET
IT WAS A FEMININE HATCHMENT
THE HATCHMENT HAD COME DOWN FROM THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR ILLEGIBILITY
BUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER MISS BRIGGS'S ARRIVAL IN REBECCA'S APARTMENT
SHE COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE TARDY OPERATIONS OF HER AMBASSADRESS
AND TWILLED LIKE A LADY'S NIGHTCAP
ENTERPRISING YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE MEASURING THE LOOKING GLASSES AND HANGINGS TO SEE IF THEY WILL SUIT THE NEW MENAGE SNOB WILL BRAG FOR YEARS THAT HE HAS PURCHASED THIS OR THAT AT DIVES'S SALE
HIS NAME HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED AS A DEFAULTER ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE
AND I HAVE HEARD AMELIA SAY THAT THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH SHE SAW HER FATHER LIFT UP HIS HEAD AFTER THE FAILURE WAS ON THE RECEIPT OF THE PACKET OF FORKS AND SPOONS WITH THE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS' LOVE
OF WHICH THEIR MENAGE PRETTY EARLY FELT THE WANT
WHO IS OCCUPIED IN BILLING AND COOING
QUITE UNSUSPICIOUSLY
ANNO DOMINI EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
AND AGREED IN REPREHENDING THE CRUEL CONDUCT OF MISTER OSBORNE TOWARDS HIS FIRST BENEFACTOR
AND THE KNOCKER PUT BY WITH MISTER BOWLS'S PLATE
MADE HELPLESSLY TIPSY BY THIS ABOMINABLE SEDUCER AND PERVERTER OF YOUTH
HAD NOT THE SMALLEST REMORSE OR COMPUNCTION FOR THE VICTIM WHOM HER TONGUE WAS IMMOLATING
THE INVALID HAD A GREAT HATRED AND SECRET TERROR OF HER VICTIMIZER
THIS PROSTRATION AND SWEET UNREPINING OBEDIENCE EXQUISITELY TOUCHED AND FLATTERED GEORGE OSBORNE
THE ONLY CHANCE GEORGE HAS OF RECONCILEMENT ARGUED HIS FRIEND
ONE OF HIS CHIEF INFORMANTS
BUT THE HESSIANS ON HIS BEAUTIFUL LEGS SHONE SO
WHO ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THE YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE HEAVIES
WHO HAS HIS INSTRUMENT POINTED SEAWARDS
THEY TURNED TOWARDS THE COACH OFFICE TO WITNESS THE LIGHTNING'S ARRIVAL
EMMY'LL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU OSBORNE SAID
MISTER CHOPPER WINKED AND NODDED AND POINTED HIS PEN TOWARDS HIS PATRON'S DOOR
WAS LAID FOR HIM IN EXPECTATION OF THAT TRUANT'S RETURN
GEORGE AS A BOY HAD BEEN HORSEWHIPPED IN THIS ROOM MANY TIMES
ALL THE HOUSEHOLD KNEW THAT SOME GREAT CATASTROPHE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHICH WAS LIKELY DIRELY TO AFFECT MASTER GEORGE
SO HE WENT UP AND LAID HIS BIG HAND ON YOUNG STUBBLE'S SHOULDER
YOUNG STUBBLE'S EYES BRIGHTENED UP AT THIS
THAT HE WAIVES ALL CLAIM UPON YOUR ESTATE
WHO WAS ATTIRING HERSELF FOR DINNER IN HER OWN CHAMBER
AS YOU SEE IN THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY'S ANTECHAMBER
HAD SEEMED TO ACT UNDUTIFULLY TOWARDS MISS CRAWLEY
AND WRUNG OFF BRIGGS'S HAND
BY MISTER CREAMER
IF HIS MERE PAST AND PERSONAL MERITS DID NOT SUCCEED IN MOLLIFYING HIS FATHER
WAS A WRETCHED UNDERLING WHO SHOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE ALL HIS BUSINESS IN LIFE TO ATTEND ON THE CAPTAIN'S PLEASURE
AS FULLY TO JUSTIFY THE ENSIGN'S COMPLIMENT
THAT FOR GOOD STREAKY BEEF
THE AUGUST JOBBERS ASSEMBLED AT VIENNA
PULLED HIS GRANDPAPA'S HAIR OFF IN THE GREEN ROOM
HER PRESENCE USED TO EXCRUCIATE OSBORNE
ALL PREVIOUS LOVES AND COURTSHIPS OF MILLINERS
ALL OF WHICH BETOKENED HER ADMIRER'S TASTE AND WEALTH
IT IS POSSIBLE HE WOULD HAVE SNOOZED ON UNTIL HIS USUAL HOUR OF RISING IN THE FORENOON
AND WHICH WAS IN SOOTH OF A VERY UNGRAMMATICAL SORT
AND SOME REMARKABLY FINE CAULIFLOWERS
FOURTH EARL OF SOUTHDOWN
HIS NAME WAS ONLY MENTIONED WITH GROANS IN THE DOWAGER'S CIRCLE
THAT SHE AND THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER HAD BEEN TO PAY SOUTHDOWN A FURTIVE VISIT AT HIS CHAMBERS IN THE ALBANY
OR ANY OTHER SORT OF BODILY MEDICAMENT
IT WAS HE WHO HAD GIVEN LADY JANE THAT COPY OF POOR BRIGGS'S EARLY POEMS
WHO LAID BEFORE LADY SOUTHDOWN THE GREAT ADVANTAGES WHICH MIGHT OCCUR FROM AN INTIMACY BETWEEN HER FAMILY AND MISS CRAWLEY
MY LORD SOUTHDOWN
TENANTRY OF MY LADY SOUTHDOWN WERE EXPECTED TO GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES WITH HER LADYSHIP
DURING THESE EXERCISES OLD SOUTHDOWN
WITH CREAMER ABOUT HER SHE MAY GO OFF ANY DAY
MOST CERTAINLY EMILY WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING LADY SOUTHDOWN SAID
LADY SOUTHDOWN
HE CAME BRINGING WITH HIM LADY SOUTHDOWN AND HER DAUGHTER
WHEN THE COUNTESS DOWAGER OF SOUTHDOWN FELL FOUL OF THE CORSICAN UPSTART
THIS ORTHODOX HORROR OF ROMISH SUPERSTITION SAVED PITT CRAWLEY IN LADY SOUTHDOWN'S OPINION
HE DID NOT TELL THE COUNTESS OF SOUTHDOWN WHAT OPINION HIS AUNT HAD FORMED OF HER LADYSHIP
WHEN THE GREAT HANDS AND ANKLES PROTRUDE A LONG WAY FROM GARMENTS WHICH HAVE GROWN TOO TIGHT FOR THEM
AND ENCHANTED BY THE PET'S CONVERSATION
SENIOR WRANGLERS AT CAMBRIDGE
HALF OF BRIGGS'S TIME AT DINNER WAS SPENT IN SUPERINTENDING THE INVALID'S COMFORT
BY THE WAY PITT CONTINUED WITH INCREASED BLANDNESS
AND GOING QUITE UNSUSPICIOUSLY TO THE DRAWING ROOM
WHEN MISTER BOWLS'S YOUNG MAN
LORD SOUTHDOWN GAVE AWAY HIS SISTER
LADY SOUTHDOWN
SHE DISMISSED CREAMER
BUT NOW THERE WAS NO HELP OR CURE OR CHANCE OF RECONCILEMENT
IN THE UNCONSECRATED CORNER OF THE GARDEN
BY THE SECOND EXAGGERATING THE UNDUTIFULNESS OF GEORGE
LET HIM TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS UNDUTIFULNESS AND FOLLY
WAS TO ALLOW THE MAJOR OCCASIONALLY TO DANDLE HIM
THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION DEFRAYS THE EXPENSES OF HIS ESTABLISHMENT
TO HAGGLE FOR BARGAINS WITH THE PERTINACITY WHICH NOW DISTINGUISHES THEM
CONTENTING HIMSELF WHILST OTHER RETIRED BUTLERS WERE VENDING SPIRITS IN PUBLIC HOUSES
OR THE POOR DEVIL OF A TAILOR WHOM THE STEWARD PATRONIZES
HOW MISS CRAWLEY'S DOMESTICS HAD BEEN DISMISSED WITH DECENT GRATUITIES
A SHEEP DOG SAID YOUNG LORD SOUTHDOWN
WHAT CAN YOU WANT WITH A SHEPHERD'S DOG THE LIVELY LITTLE SOUTHDOWN CONTINUED
THE FATHER WOULD BRING HIM SWEETMEATS FROM THE DESSERT AND HIDE THEM IN A CERTAIN OLD EPAULET BOX
LITTLE LORD SOUTHDOWN
BUNKER'S WHARF
WITH SUCH AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS GRACE'S SENTIMENTS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT IT WAS CLEAR HE MUST HAVE BEEN BY THE CONQUEROR'S SIDE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
AND HUMBLE HUSBAND OF THE OCCUPIER OF THE DINGY THRONE
HE TOLD ME THAT DAFFY'S ELIXIR WAS POISON
CRUTCHED FRIARS
MISS GRITS
WHOSE HOPES RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF THEIR RICH KINSWOMAN'S PROPERTY WERE SO WOEFULLY DISAPPOINTED
HOW FAR HER OWN TYRANNOUS BEHAVIOUR HAD TENDED TO RUIN HER HUSBAND
WAS IT HER FAULT IF SHE DID NOT POSSESS THOSE SYCOPHANTIC ARTS WHICH HER HYPOCRITICAL NEPHEW
BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER BROTHER SOUTHDOWN HAD MUSTACHIOS
THE COUNTESS SOUTHDOWN KEPT ON DROPPING PER COACH AT THE LODGE GATE THE MOST EXCITING TRACTS
HE THRUMMED ON THE TABLE AS IF IT HAD BEEN A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
THEY BEAR COMPLAINTS AND QUERULOUSNESS
AND INQUIRIES FOR THE HEALTH OF THEIR LADYSHIPS
TO DEPOSE LADY SOUTHDOWN
WE MIGHT TAKE SOUTHDOWN'S CARRIAGE
AND MISTER PITT WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF MUCH INJURED BY THE UNCALLED FOR GENEROSITY OF HIS DECEASED RELATIVE TOWARDS A LADY WHO HAD ONLY BEEN MISS CRAWLEY'S FAITHFUL RETAINER A SCORE OF YEARS MADE NO OBJECTION TO THAT EXERCISE OF THE DOWAGER'S AUTHORITY
QUARRELLED OVER MISS BRIGGS'S FORTY POUNDS A YEAR AS EAGERLY AND MORE OPENLY THAN MISS CRAWLEY'S KINSFOLK HAD FOR THAT LADY'S INHERITANCE
BRIGGS'S BROTHER
HAD HOLD OF BOTH BRIGGS'S HANDS
AND DID NOT LIKE THE LATTER'S ACCOUNT OF THE COLONEL'S MENAGE
A GRAND PAINTED HATCHMENT WAS ALREADY OVER THE GREAT ENTRANCE
AND THEN SHE MENTIONED HOW OFTEN SHE HAD HEARD OF LADY SOUTHDOWN FROM THAT EXCELLENT MAN THE REVEREND LAWRENCE GRILLS
AND CONFIRMED HERSELF IN LADY SOUTHDOWN'S FAVOUR
AND TO SWALLOW THE MEDICINE UNDER THE UNYIELDING OLD DOWAGER'S NOSE
DESCRIBED THE OCCURRENCE AND HOW SHE HAD BEEN VICTIMIZED BY LADY SOUTHDOWN
AWAITING THEIR FINAL CONSIGNMENT TO THE FAMILY CRYPT
THE NEIGHBOURING GENTRY'S CARRIAGES AT THREE MILES AN HOUR
THE GENTRY'S CARRIAGES WHEELED OFF TO THEIR DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS
SPECKLING WITH BLACK THE PUBLIC HOUSE ENTRANCES
WHEN REBECCA WOULD TAKE HER PLACE BY THE DOWAGER'S SIDE AND LISTEN TO HER SOLEMN TALK WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST
NOT WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY AND GRUMBLING ON MISTER BULLOCK'S PART
AND DEMEANED HIMSELF IN HIS USUAL VIOLENT MANNER
SO HE KNUCKLED DOWN AGAIN TO USE HIS OWN PHRASE
AND INDISCREETLY BEGGING HER FATHER TO QUIT THAT ODIOUS VULGAR PLACE
AND THE HONOURABLES TO HERSELF
DAMN HONOURABLES
F BULLOCK'S COSTUME
AND THE SOUREST SPINSTER IS KIND TO THEM
WHERE OLD MISTER CHUTNEY
WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE CIVIL SERVICE AND WHO AFTERWARDS MARRIED MISS DOLBY
OR ANGRY BECAUSE CAPTAIN BANGLES OF THE CAVALRY HANDED HER TO SUPPER
SO THESE TWO WERE EACH EXEMPLIFYING THE VANITY OF THIS LIFE
UNDECEIVING HER WITH RESPECT TO THE REPORTS CONCERNING HIM AND ASSURING HER THAT HE HAD NO SORT OF PRESENT INTENTION OF ALTERING HIS CONDITION
AND YOUR LITTLE GODSON OVERATE HIMSELF AT OUR HOUSE
STILL BORE OVER ITS FRONT THE HATCHMENT WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED THERE AS A TOKEN OF MOURNING FOR SIR PITT CRAWLEY'S DEMISE
A FIRE WAS BLAZING ALREADY IN SIR PITT'S APARTMENT IT WAS MISS BRIGGS'S ROOM
ON BRIGGS'S SPECIAL BEHALF
AND HOW OLD LADY SOUTHDOWN WAS GONE
WHAT PANGS MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE OF LADY SOUTHDOWN
SO KIND TO DEANS AND CHAPTERS
INTO THE OTHER OPENINGS OF WHICH FERRETS WERE INSERTED
TOM MOODY'S SON
UNMATCHED AT RATING
AND THE MERITS OF SNIVELLER AND DIAMOND
AND AT THEIR CANINE BICKERINGS
SCARCELY RESTRAINED BY TOM MOODY'S TONGUE AND LASH
AND LARKING OVER THE NEWEST GATES IN THE COUNTRY
WHEREAS GOLDING'S MOTHER CAME IN A CARRIAGE TO FETCH HIM EVERY SATURDAY
AS BY THE FINES AND CONFISCATIONS LEVIED ON IT BY ELIZABETH FOR HARBOURING OF PRIESTS
THE HAUGHTIEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND
TOM EAVES'S HAT WOULD DROP OFF HIS HEAD
AS YOU THE READER DO NOT SAY NAY OR I THE WRITER HEREOF WOULD GO IF WE HAD AN INVITATION
BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX
OR THE ELDERLY SULTANAS OF OUR VANITY FAIR SHOULD DRIVE UP IN CLOSED LITTERS
DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK
THE EARL OF SOUTHDOWN
WHICH NIGHTLY FILLS CASINOS AND DANCING ROOMS
AND THEIR LADYSHIPS
THEIR LADYSHIPS MADE THREE STATELY CURTSIES
VAINLY HOPING THAT HE WOULD REPURCHASE THEM WHEN ORNAMENTED BY HER HAND CAN HARDLY HIDE THE SNEER WITH WHICH HE EXAMINES THESE FEEBLE WORKS OF ART
AND SHE CONFIDES THE CARD TO THE GENTLEMAN OF THE FINE ART REPOSITORY
ONE BY ONE THE OUTWORKS OF THE LITTLE CITADEL WERE TAKEN
DAYS WERE PASSED IN PARLEYS VISITS PREPARATIONS
THEY ARE BORN TIMID AND TYRANTS AND MALTREAT THOSE WHO ARE HUMBLEST BEFORE THEM
DOORS SO GREAT AND TALL THAT THE BELOVED READER AND WRITER HEREOF MAY HOPE IN VAIN TO ENTER AT THEM
IT SCORCHES HIM UP
THE YOUNG MEN FAULTLESSLY APPOINTED
THERE IS PASTA BEGINNING TO SING
WHO WAS UNSUSPICIOUSLY EATING HER DINNER
HATTERS AND ARMY ACCOUTREMENT MAKERS
AND CALL HIM THE GREATEST RASCAL UNHANGED
BANGLES
WHAT IS THAT GHASTLY FACE LOOKING OUT BALEFULLY AFTER HIM FROM BEHIND THE ARRAS
SERVANTS BROUGHT IN SALVERS COVERED WITH NUMEROUS COOL DAINTIES
AND PRESENTLY CHAMBERMAID THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD SOUTHDOWN WITH TWO CANDLESTICKS
HE CHUCKS CHAMBERMAID THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD SOUTHDOWN UNDER THE CHIN
AND LITTLE LORD SOUTHDOWN NOW APPEARED ADMIRABLY ATTIRED IN THE DISGUISE OF AN OLD WOMAN HOBBLING ABOUT THE STAGE WITH A FAULTLESS CROOKED STICK
THE ROSE UPON MY BALCONY THE ROSE UPON MY BALCONY THE MORNING AIR PERFUMING WAS LEAFLESS ALL THE WINTER TIME AND PINING FOR THE SPRING
AND THOUGH HIS CHIEF RECOLLECTIONS OF POLITE LEARNING WERE CONNECTED WITH THE FLOGGINGS WHICH HE RECEIVED AT ETON IN HIS EARLY YOUTH
MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID BLUBBERED IN THE PASSAGE WHEN HE WENT AWAY
HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM THAT HE HAD BORROWED BRIGGS'S MONEY AND AIDED IN DECEIVING HER
AND HOW YOUNG BLACKBALL
AND BREAKFAST TOASTER
AND FAGGING IN GENERAL
PILKINGTON
THE WEIGHT WAS OFF HIS CONSCIENCE ABOUT POOR BRIGGS'S MONEY
REPROBATED IN STRONG TERMS THE HABIT OF PLAY ACTING AND FANCY DRESSING AS HIGHLY UNBECOMING A BRITISH FEMALE
INDEED MISTER MOSS'S HOUSE
CHOSE ONE WHICH WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BETWEEN MISS MOSS'S OWN FINGER AND THUMB
AND KNOCKING AT THE GREAT BRONZE MEDUSA'S HEAD WHICH STANDS ON THE PORTAL OF GAUNT HOUSE
THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE
THE WHITE CASHMERE DRESSING GOWN FLOUNCING AROUND HER
THEN SHE WENT INTO THE FRENCHWOMAN'S GARRET
ABOUT MADEMOISELLE ARIANE OF THE FRENCH OPERA
LITTLE SOUTHDOWN WAS SORRY
LADY SOUTHDOWN WROTE IT OFF TO HER OTHER DAUGHTER AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
AND GENTLEMANLIKE APPEARANCE OF THE BOY WON THE GRANDSIRE'S HEART FOR HIM
FLUSHED WITH PRAISE AND VICTORY OVER MASTER TOFFY
HIS LIKENESS TO HIS FATHER DEAD UNRECONCILED IN BRUSSELS YONDER AWED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND GAVE THE YOUNG BOY THE MASTERY
AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE SOLITARY RESIGNATIONS AND UNSEEN SACRIFICES
HER LIFE BEGUN NOT UNPROSPEROUSLY HAD COME DOWN TO THIS
TO SUFFER THE HARASSMENT AND TYRANNY OF QUERULOUS DISAPPOINTED OLD AGE
WHOSE RANK MAY BE AN ANCESTOR'S ACCIDENT
BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THESE TWO PEOPLE LONG IN SUCH A LOW AND UNGENTEEL STATION OF LIFE
AND POOR LITTLE RICKETTS
WITH A THOUSAND EJACULATORY BREAKS IN THE NARRATIVE
OF GEORGE'S RECONCILEMENT WITH HIS GRANDFATHER OSBORNE
MARY LOOKED AT HIM RATHER ROGUISHLY
YET THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WICKED IN HER TO REPINE AT LOSING HIM
YOU WILL BE CHARMED WITH MISTER VEAL'S PARTIES
AND WEPT OVER IT PLENTEOUSLY
TAKING FAKE'S PLACE
HE HUNG FONDLY BY HIS GODFATHER'S SIDE
AT GRANDPAPA'S
DON'T THE CLERGYMEN'S LADIES DISCOURSE ABOUT SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND WHO TAKES WHOSE DUTY
HAD SHE NOT BEEN PERSECUTED AND UNDERVALUED
IMPIOUSLY INDEED
THE MARRIAGE HE SAID AT WHICH HIS INTERLOCUTOR'S FACE GREW DARK WAS VERY MUCH MY DOING
NEVERTHELESS SHOWED HER CHARITABLENESS OF SPIRIT BY BEING RECONCILED TO THE MOTHER AND THE BOY
FREDERICK BULLOCK'S HOSPITALITIES
HE WENT TO SLEEP UNDER FREDERICK BULLOCK'S BALD HEAD
MISTER KIRSCH WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH A SINGLE ONE
AND SPOKE ALL WITH INDIFFERENT VOLUBILITY AND INCORRECTNESS
HE PASSED THE NIGHT DIREFULLY SICK IN HIS CARRIAGE
SHE HAS BEEN DOMINEERED OVER HITHERTO BY VULGAR INTELLECTS
THE BLASE ATTACHE
THE TRANSPARENT CARRIAGES DROVE AWAY TO THE OLD DUCAL SCHLOSS
WHEN TAPEWORM'S DOCTOR CAME
CAME EAGERLY TO THIS PART OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND HANKERED ROUND THE TABLES WHERE THE CROUPIERS AND THE PUNTERS WERE AT WORK
BUT ALL HER ENERGIES RALLIED THE INSTANT SHE SAW BECKY SMILING ROGUISHLY UNDER A PINK BONNET
HER TASTE FOR DISRESPECTABILITY GREW MORE AND MORE REMARKABLE
ONLY THAT THE LATTER DISOWNS THEM
AND DUBIOUS ANTIQUES
BUT EVERY MAN WHO HAS FORMED ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE ARMY OF TRAVELLERS HAS SEEN THESE MARAUDING IRREGULARS HANGING ON
SO WELL KNOWN FOR HIS BRILLIANT ENTOMOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS
TENANTED BY THE BAND OF RENOWNED BOHEMIAN VAULTERS AND TUMBLERS
AND SHE GAVE THE CIVILIAN'S HAND A LITTLE SQUEEZE AND LAUGHINGLY PLACED HIM UPON IT
THIS WOMAN HAD A WAY OF TYRANNIZING OVER MAJOR DOBBIN FOR THE WEAKEST OF ALL PEOPLE WILL DOMINEER OVER SOMEBODY
IS IT UNFAITHFULNESS TO MY HUSBAND
AND IF WE ARE COME TO BANDYING REPROACHES
AND HE LOOKED BACK OBSERVANTLY BUT NOT EXPRESSIVELY AT HER
I FANCY SHE DOES IT OUT OF TACTFULNESS
SHE ISN'T AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF LADY CONROY'S AT ALL
A CHANGE OF ENTOURAGE AS WE SAY ABROAD WOULD DO YOU GOOD
HERS WAS THE SORT OF SKIN WITH A SATINY TEXTURE THAT IMPROVES UNDER BRIGHT SUNSHINE OR ELECTRIC LIGHT
THE ABSURD IRRITATIONS AND SCENES OF FAULT FINDING THAT SHE HAD BECOME INURED TO
IN ANY TIMETABLE
NOBODY MADE SO MANY GAFFES YET NO ONE GOT OUT OF THEM SO WELL
SHE USED SO MANY WORDS THAT SHE MANAGED TO ENGULF HER OWN AND HER INTERLOCUTOR'S IDEAS
THE FUTURIST IS OFF THE RAILS ENTIRELY
BUT HIS ILLUSTRATIONS TO WILDE'S WORK WERE UNSUITABLE
LOOKED IN AFTER A PATRIOTIC CONCERT GIVEN IN ORDER TO HELP THE UNENGAGED PROFESSIONALS
ON DANCING THE FOX TROT TO THE SOUND OF A GRAMOPHONE
IT WAS CHARMINGLY FURNISHED IN THE PRIM CHIPPENDALE STYLE
HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT THE SIMPLE OBJECTIVENESS OF THE CHILD WHO WANTS TO LOOK AT THE WORLD
IT WAS A SNAPSHOT TAKEN THE WINTER BEFORE THEY HAD PARTED
CALLED LYRISTS OF THE RESTORATION
GUMMING AND STICKING TOGETHER OF THESE OBJECTS THAN IN COMPOSING THE MELODIES THAT WERE KNOWN AND LOVED ALL OVER THE WORLD
HIS VALETUDINARIANISM HAD BEEN TERRIBLY INCREASED BY THE ANXIETY AND WORRY OF THE WAR
I SHALL GO STRAIGHT BACK TO CLARIDGE'S IN A TAXI
OF A STOCK WITH WHICH BLOOD ROYAL ITSELF MIGHT BE ALLIED WITHOUT DEROGATION
WHICH HAS LEFT RUDDERLESS AN EXISTENCE THAT HAD SET SAIL SO GAILY FOR GLORIOUS HAPPINESS
ITS LANDS AND DEPENDENCIES
THOUGH CHIEFLY MORAVIAN
BUT IN REALITY FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF DELICIOUS SYLVAN AND RUSTIC IDLENESS THROUGH WHICH THE MEMORY OF RECENT VIENNESE DISSIPATIONS WAS LIKE THAT OF A FEVERED DREAM
THAT I SHOULD GRATIFY SOME OF THIS YOUNG ENGLISH NOBLEMAN'S CURIOSITY CONCERNING THE WANDERING OF A PRINCESS IN SO UNPRINCELY A FASHION
IN SPITE OF HER LADY IN WAITING'S WELL KNOWN GIFT OF ENTERTAINMENT
AND IT IS SCHULTZ'S BUSINESS
AND I FELT MYSELF DEGRADED TO THE LEVEL OF MY ADMINISTRATOR'S BRUTALITY
ADDED MY UNCLE SNIGGERING
AND WHICH EVEN SCHULTZ'S STOUT CANE FAILED TO DISPERSE
SCHULTZ HAD GENEROUSLY CARRIED OUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS
BUT HER NURSLING SHE LOVED IN QUITE AS VEHEMENT A FASHION
SHE SLIPPED OUT FROM UNDER HER LONG RIDING SKIRT THE SMALL UNBOOTED FOOT IN ITS SHINING PINK SILK STOCKING
PERPETUAL EXPATRIATION
THE SECRETNESS OF THE ACTION STIRRED THE HEAT OF MY FEELINGS AGAINST HER YET MORE
THERE WILL BE THE NECESSITY OF DISINFECTION
I KNEW HE WOULD NOT READ THE TELL TALE INSCRIPTION UNTIL THE UNPOETIC PROCESS HE HAD SO FEELINGLY LAMENTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE THROUGH
I THREW A HASTY GLANCE IN THE MIRROR TO NOTE THAT THE PALLOR OF MY COUNTENANCE AND THE DISORDER OF MY UNPOWDERED HAIR WERE AFTER ALL NOT UNBECOMING
FOR THAT MINUTE NO POOR CHAINED BEDLAMITE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DANGEROUSLY MAD THAN I BUT MY BRITISH DREAD OF RIDICULE SAVED MY LIFE THAT DAY
AND IT WAS IN SILENCE THAT WE CONCLUDED THE TRANSIT BETWEEN ROTHENBURG AND THE BORDER
ALTHOUGH MOST UNTRULY
IN LESS THAN A MONTH FROM THE DATE OF THE ILL FATED ROTHENBURG EXPEDITION I FOUND MYSELF BREATHING MY NATIVE AIR AGAIN
IF YOU WOULD NOT ADD YET MORE TO THE BITTERNESS OF MY LOT YOU WILL STRENUOUSLY DENY THE REPORT YOU INDISCREETLY SPREAD
THAT YOU ENTIRELY CONCUR IN THE LADY'S DESIRE FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THIS CONTESTABLE UNION
THE TEAM WILL HAVE TO GO NEXT IF I DON'T GET BACK SOME OF MY I O U'S
DAUGHTER OF SOME DUKE OF ALSATIA
THAT HIS BROCADE JACKET WAS JAGGEDLY RENT UPON THE LEFT SIDE
AND SEEMED TO LEND BUT A HALF APPREHENDING EAR TO THE PRATTLER ON HIS LEFT
SKEWERED LIKE A CHICKEN
ALMOST HAGGARD IN SPITE OF ITS YOUTH AND CHUBBINESS
BUT I HAD NOT BEEN WONT TO HEAR IT COME SO LAGGINGLY
I DASHED THE SWEAT FROM MY BROW FOR I HAD COME LIKE A LAMPLIGHTER
OR WAS IT ONLY THE PLEBEIAN INSTINCT REASSERTING ITSELF IN SPITE OF ALL
THESE STRUCK ME NEVERTHELESS AS STRANGE UNHOMELY TIDINGS WHICH OPENED FRESH DIFFICULTIES IN MY PATH DIFFICULTIES THE FULL IMPORT OF WHICH WERE EVERY SECOND MORE STRONGLY BORNE UPON ME
SURE IT IS THAT BIGAMY MUST SEEM A VERY PECCADILLO
THEN SHE PUT HER HAND TO HER HEAD EJACULATING
WITH HER SKIRTS WELL KILTED UP
AND INDEED HIS OLD CAMPAIGNER'S WITS PROMPTLY WENT ONE BETTER THAN THE PEASANT'S SHREWDNESS
NOTHING SEEMS MORE DREAMLIKE THAN THE WAY IN WHICH MY BODING THOUGHT SUDDENLY ASSUMED THE REALITY OF ACTUAL EVENT
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DESTROY A MODERN BATTLESHIP IS BY RAMMING
HE SAID STUMBLINGLY
CAUSES IT TO DISINTEGRATE
AND IN CORRELATING THE MASS OF DATA CONCERNING THE NAVIES OF THE WORLD
WHEN SHE GLANCED UP AND SAW MY UNCOMPREHENDING FACE
AS SHE TALKED OF VELOCITIES AND LENGTHS
THE UNEXPECTED SETBACK OF MY ARREST NOW SAFELY OVER
RANGED WITH MATHEMATICAL PRECISENESS
BRING ME THE LOGARITHM TABLES
IN ONE PLACE ONLY WERE THESE DEPUTATIONS RECEIVED WITH NO CONSIDERATION
REFLECTED BACK THE LANTERN'S FLAME
COPPER BREASTPLATE AND TWILLED OVERALLS
LUXURIATING IN THE RESPITE AND
SAID THE BOY BRIEFLY AS HE SAT PHLEGMATICALLY BESIDE THE ENGINE
A CHORUS OF AFFIRMATIVES CAME BACK
THE LABORERS AND THE CHARWOMEN PASSING THROUGH THE GARDEN BELOW
CLOTHED IN RAINCOAT AND SLOUCH HAT
LOOMED BULKIER THAN EVER
WITH AN ELEPHANTINE GRACE
DISAPPEARED QUITE AS SUDDENLY INTO THE BLANKETING DARKNESS
FILLED WITH LABELLED REAGENT BOTTLES
IF ONE OF YOU GENTLEMEN WILL GET ANOTHER CONNECTOR AND FIX IT TO A SOCKET
SHE SHONE UPON THE WORLD THROUGH EVERY FACET
FORCING IT TO SUBMIT TO THE CURRENT'S TREMENDOUS FORCE
AND ENTERED TO FIND THE BROAD TABLE OF HER SUNNY PARLOR COVERED WITH PILES OF NEAT CLIPPINGS
AS HE STOOD WITH A BUNDLE OF CLIPPINGS BETWEEN EVERY FINGER OF BOTH HANDS
TOM REACHED INTO HIS POCKET AND PULLED OUT A LONG ENVELOPE WITH THE TWENTY SIX CLIPPINGS
WE WERE COLONIALS FROM AUSTRALIA SEEKING OUR COUSIN GEORGE
OR IT MAY BE SOME BUNCH OF COUNTERFEITERS OR OTHER CRIMINALS
BEARING THAT ACCOLADE
TOM HAD FAR OUTDISTANCED ME AS A KNIFE JUGGLER AND I WAS LAGGING FAR IN THE REAR
A FLOOD OF UNINTELLIGIBLE GUTTURALS FOLLOWED MY STATEMENT
CAREFULLY WATCHING THE ASSISTANT'S FACE
THAT'S BACKBREAKING WORK ALL RIGHT
THE MAID STOOD AT A SHAMBLING ATTENTION IN THE DOORWAY
ALL THE WAY HOME THE LUDICROUSNESS OF OUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR COMEDY OF ERRORS KEPT GROWING ON ME
I BEGAN TO WORRY A BIT ABOUT THIS STRANGE ABSTRACTEDNESS
IT WAS ONE OF THE HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS
WHEREUPON UP CAME THE DROMEDARIES LIKE LIGHTNING
THY SHAPE'S TEMPTATION
FOR THAT HER HEART WAS COMFORTED AND ALLAH HAD REUNITED HER WITH HER SON VERSIFIED WITH THESE COUPLETS
FOR I FEAR THE AIR FOR HER WHEN IT BLOWETH
ONE OF WHOM WAS A YEARLING BABE AND THE OTHER TWO YEARS OLD
SHE PINED FOR HER DAUGHTER IN LAW AND HER GRANDCHILDREN AND FOR THE SIGHT OF HER SON AND VERSIFIED WITH THESE COUPLETS
SO HE DISMISSED THE DROMEDARIES THEN ASKED HER OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND SHE WEPT TILL SHE FAINTED
THEIR IMAGE BIDES WITH ME
I'M UNHEALED OF ILLNESS IN HEART AND SPRITE
HE VERSIFIED WITH THESE COUPLETS
LIKE THE BLINDING LEVEN
BUT I'M FORGONE
THIS YOUTH IS TO BE PITIED AND HAPLY THOU WILT AID HIM TO RECOVER HIS WIFE AND WEES
BUT THAT BY THE WAY ARE MANY PERILS AND THIRSTY WOLDS FULL OF TERRORS
WHEN SHE SAW HIS ARDENCY AND TRANSPORT AND ANGUISH AND DISTRESS
WHEN THE SUN RISETH ON THEM
THERE ROSE TO VIEW THE GREEN DOME AND THE JETTING FOUNT AND THE EMERALD PALACE
BETWEEN BELIEF AND MISBELIEF
EATING AND DRINKING AND PLEASURING
WHO ALSO BOUGHT A DINAR'S WORTH OF FISH
WHOSE LIKE SEERS NEVER SAW
FOREGATHERING WITH THE CALIPH
HE ROSE TO HIM AND FOREWENT HIM
WILL EVER TIME BRING OUR BELOVEDS BACK AGAIN
NOW IT FORTUNED ONE NIGHT
CHECKMATE AND BEAT HIM
AND HE ANSWERED HOW MANY A PROMISE MADE IS UNKEPT OF ITS MAKER
WHEREFORE HE MISDOUBTED HER
HIS LAMENTATION IS LENGTHENED AND RESTLESSNESS IS STRENGTHENED AND HE IS AS HE WERE A BIRD UNMATED WHILE FOR SUDDEN DEATH HE AWAITETH ALAS
THEY NIGHTED ON THIS WISE AND NEXT MORNING THE JEW ROSE UP IN HASTE AND WENT OUT TO ORDER NEW SHACKLES
SHALL I BE CONSOLED WHEN LOVE HATH MASTERED THE SECRET OF ME AND MY HEART IS AGLOW WITH MORE THAN THE CHARCOAL'S ARDENCY
WE WISH THEE TO GO THIS DAY A PLEASURING WITH US IN SUCH A GARDEN
THE SONS OF THE MERCHANTS HAVE INVITED ME TO WEND A PLEASURING WITH THEM IN SUCH A GARDEN
THE BIDDINGS FOR THIS THY SLAVE GIRL HAVE REACHED NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DINARS
THAT THOU WOULDST SELL ME TO THIS WORN OUT FATHER ANTIC
WILT THOU SELL ME TO HIM O UNLUCKIEST OF BROKERS
PERFECT IN LOVELINESS AND A MODEL OF FINE STATURE AND SYMMETRIC GRACE
HOW HIGH ARE THE BIDDINGS FOR HER HE REPLIED
HER FACE IS FAIRER THAN THE STARS OF WEALTH AND SHEENY BROWS THE CRESCENT MOON EXCEL
BETWEEN BELIEF AND MISBELIEF
ALLAH WILL OPEN TO ME OTHERWISE THAN BY MY VENDING IT
IT FORTUNED ONE YEAR THAT SHE FELL SICK OF AN EXCEEDING SICKNESS AND CAME NIGH UPON DEATH
THE MONOCULAR
ASK AMID MANKIND AND MY RAILERS SHALL SAY THAT MINE EYELIDS ARE DROWNING THESE EYEBALLS OF MINE
WILL TO ME AND YOU THE RUTHFUL UNION SHOW MY LORDS
MOANING LANGUISHMENT
TYRANT DESPOTICAL WHOSE TYRANNY BUT GROWS THE MORE
AND HEAVY WAS MY HEART AS I STOOD AFAR OFF SO THAT GAVIN'S MOTHER MIGHT NOT HAVE THE PAIN OF SEEING ME
AS GAVIN PUT HIS EAGER BOYISH FACE OUT AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW
WHICH GAVIN ACCEPTED
MY MIND HAD DRIFTED BACK TO THE FIRST TIME I SAW GAVIN AND THE EGYPTIAN TOGETHER
WHEN GAVIN CAME TO THRUMS HE WAS AS I AM NOW
ON THE MAD NIGHT YOU DANCED INTO GAVIN'S LIFE
AND WHEN I PICTURE YOU AS GAVIN SAW YOU FIRST
AND I CANNOT WONDER THAT GAVIN LOVED YOU
OFTEN I SAY TO MYSELF THAT THIS IS TO BE GAVIN'S STORY NOT MINE
AND GAVIN
GAZED AT HER AND GAVIN
HE IN WHOSE WAYS GAVIN WAS TO ATTEMPT THE HEAVY TASK OF WALKING HAD BEEN A WIDOWER THREE MONTHS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE
A MAN NARROW WHEN HE CAME TO THRUMS
GAVIN ONLY SAW A VERY FRAIL OLD MINISTER WHO SHOOK AS HE WALKED
IT OUTLIVES ME
HIS EYES CAME BACK TO GAVIN'S EAGER FACE
I AM AFRAID GAVIN SAID ANXIOUSLY THAT I LOOK EVEN YOUNGER
IF GAVIN HAD BEEN LESS BIGOTED THAN HE ON THIS QUESTION THEY MIGHT HAVE PARTED STIFFLY
AND YET GAVIN SAID
AND EVER SINCE THE RISING A WATCH HAS BEEN KEPT BY NIGHT ON EVERY ROAD THAT LEADS TO THRUMS
GAVIN SPOKE WITH FEELING
HE LEFT GAVIN
GAVIN FOUND HIS MOTHER WONDERING HOW ONE SHOULD SET ABOUT GETTING A CUP OF TEA IN A HOUSE THAT HAD A SERVANT IN IT
SO ANXIOUS WAS SHE TO PLEASE THAT WHEN GAVIN RANG SHE FIRED HERSELF AT THE BEDROOM
AS GAVIN MADE A TOO LIBERAL OFFER
THE CONVERSATION CAME TO GAVIN AND MARGARET THROUGH THE KITCHEN DOORWAY
A BETTER CURLER I DARE SAY
GAVIN ARRANGED HER PILLOWS AS SHE LIKED THEM
I DARE SAY SHE SAW AT THAT MOMENT GAVIN IN HIS FIRST FROCK
AND GAVIN AS HE USED TO WALK INTO THE GLASGOW ROOM FROM COLLEGE
PERHAPS IT HAD BEEN ON SUCH A SILENT NIGHT AS THIS THAT THE SOLDIERS MARCHED INTO THRUMS
GAVIN SAW HIS MOTHER BESIDE HIM BARE HEADED TREMBLING
OH GAVIN WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM
AS GAVIN TOOK HER HAND HE KNEW THAT MARGARET FELT FOR THE PEOPLE MORE THAN HE
SEEKING TO ESCAPE FROM THRUMS BY THE FIELDS HE HAD DESCENDED
I WILL NOT DESERT MY PEOPLE GAVIN SAID
DOES ANY ONE KNOW WHO SHE IS GAVIN DEMANDED
SHOW ME THIS WOMAN GAVIN SAID STERNLY TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING
AND THUS THE HEART OF THRUMS IS A BOX
GAVIN COULD NOT SEE THE EGYPTIAN
AND GAVIN CAST HIS EYE OVER THE ARMED MEN
BUT EVEN IN THAT HOUR MANY OF THE PEOPLE WERE UNBONNETED
IF YOU FIGHT CRIED GAVIN
GAVIN SAW THE CROWD OPEN
I COMMAND YOU CRIED GAVIN
SHE HAS A FALSE TONGUE GAVIN CRIED
BELIEVE HER NOT CRIED GAVIN
YOU SEE YOU SEE THE GYPSY SAID FLASHING TRIUMPH AT GAVIN
WITHIN A MINUTE AFTER GAVIN SAW THE GLEAM OF THE RING ON HER FINGER
I WANT TO HEAR NOTHING ABOUT THAT GAVIN SAID QUICKLY
FOR THE MOMENT GAVIN WAS SO LOST IN MISERY OVER THE PROBABLE EFFECT OF THE NIGHT'S RIOTING THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHERE HE WAS
BY THE TIME GAVIN WAS BREATHING FREELY AGAIN THE LOCK UP WAS CRAMMED WITH PRISONERS
AND ON WAKENING IN THE MORNING YOKING TO HIS LOOM AS USUAL
HE LOOKED AT HER UNDECIDEDLY
THEY TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT THRUMS WAS REMARKABLE FOR THE FEROCITY OF ITS WOMEN
THIS ONE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED GAVIN SAID FIRMLY
AND IT WOULD BE A BRIGHT DAY FOR THRUMS THAT SAW THE LAST OF HER
FIFTY YARDS IN FRONT OF HIM GAVIN SAW THE ROAD END IN A WALL OF SOLDIERS
FOR A MOMENT GAVIN HAD IT IN HIS HEART TO WARN HER
GAVIN TURNED FROM HER
GAVIN HAD ALMOST REACHED THEM WHEN A LITTLE HAND TOUCHED HIS ARM
IN AN ELEGANT ENGLISH VOICE THAT MADE GAVIN STARE AT HER
SERGEANT SAID GAVIN FIRMLY I MUST
BUT CRIED GAVIN
THEN WHY DID YOU NOT HAND ME OVER GAVIN GROANED
THEN IT WAS AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT SAID GAVIN
HAVE YOU NO RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER DEMANDED GAVIN
WHICH GAVE GAVIN THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING HER UNHAPPY
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU GAVIN REPEATED WEAKLY
AND GAVIN WALKED SCORNFULLY AWAY FROM IT
I AM NOT A POLICEMAN REPLIED GAVIN
AND GAVIN WOULD NOT LET HIS EYES FOLLOW HER
GAVIN'S SHORTNESS HAD GRIEVED HIM ALL HIS LIFE
GAVIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT IS MY MOTHER GAVIN SAID
STOP GAVIN CALLED
TO HER THIS WAS TO RAVEL THE DAY A DIRE THING
THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED GAVIN
WHILE IT MATTERED MUCH TO GAVIN
SHE WENT INSTEAD INTO GAVIN'S ROOM TO LOOK ADMIRINGLY AT HIM AS HE SLEPT
OFTEN GAVIN WOKE TO FIND THAT HIS MOTHER HAD SLIPPED IN TO SAVE HIM THE ENORMOUS TROUBLE OF OPENING A DRAWER FOR A CLEAN COLLAR
BUT LESS SOOTHING TO GAVIN
ON THIS MORNING MARGARET ONLY OPENED GAVIN'S DOOR TO STAND AND LOOK
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE CAME TO THRUMS
GAVIN WAS ROUSED PRESENTLY BY THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM MARGARET'S ROOM
GAVIN LISTENED TO NO MORE
AND GAVIN SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR
OF AN EGYPTIAN WOMAN GAVIN SAID TO HIS MOTHER NERVOUSLY
I NOTICED HERS GAVIN SAID
BEAUTY OF HER KIND GAVIN EXPLAINED LEARNEDLY
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO MOTHER GAVIN ASKED A LITTLE UNEASILY
NEVER ANSWERED GAVIN WITH A VIOLENCE THAT ENDED THE CONVERSATION
GAVIN HAD NOT TO ASK HIMSELF THE QUESTION
NOW LET THOSE WHO THINK THAT GAVIN HAS NOT YET PAID TOLL FOR TAKING THE ROAD WITH THE EGYPTIAN
JEAN GAVIN ASKED
GAVIN CARRIED THE CLOAK TO HIS BEDROOM
GAVIN STOWED THE CLOAK BENEATH THE GARRET BED
GAVIN TOOK MARGARET DOWN TO THE PARLOUR
HE SAW THAT THE RESURRECTIONIST WAS A DOG
THE EGYPTIAN'S CLOAK HAS BEEN FOUND MARGARET WAS ABLE TO TELL GAVIN NEXT DAY
IN HIS GARDEN GAVIN ASKED HURRIEDLY
WHOM HAS HE GIVEN IT TO MOTHER GAVIN ASKED
WERE IT NOT ONE OF GAVIN'S MILESTONES
SINCE MARGARET AND HER SON CAME TO THE MANSE I HAD KEPT THE VOW MADE TO MYSELF AND AVOIDED THRUMS
BEING PRECENTOR
FEELING THAT GAVIN'S ACTION WAS UNSOUND
IT COULD NEVER BE SAID OF GAVIN THAT HE NEEDED TO READ
TELLS IN A WHISPER OF MAN'S FALL DURING THE CURLING SEASON NO SNOW COULD BE SEEN IN THRUMS BY THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR
THAT IS THE MAN SAID GAVIN
AND THOUGH THE THRUMS POOR HELP EACH OTHER BRAVELY
GOD HELP HER EXCLAIMED GAVIN
FOR THE WEBSTERS ARE ESTABLISHED KIRK
IF YOU HAD NOT EXPLAINED THAT SAID GAVIN
WAS ALREADY STANDING UP TO CATCH A FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE CURLERS
I NEVER SAW IT PLAYED BEFORE GAVIN SAID STANDING UP IN HIS TURN
A DEMOCRACY AT ALL EVENTS SAID GAVIN
DOCTOR SAID GAVIN
AND I SEE YOU DID NOT DIE SAID GAVIN
ENJOYING GAVIN'S DISCOMFITURE
FOR GAVIN'S PRESENCE IN IT ANNOYED HIM
I THINK THE FROST IS TO HOLD SAID GAVIN
GAVIN LOOKED VERY GRAVE
BUT GAVIN SILENT
WERE YOU EVER IN LOVE NEVER ANSWERED GAVIN VIOLENTLY
PERHAPS ON HER WAY TO THRUMS FOR GOSSIP
AND GAVIN AND THE DOCTOR KNEW IT AS THEY SAW NANNY CLINGING TO HER PROTECTOR
YOU DON'T SEE GAVIN BEGAN BUT HER INDIGNATION STOPPED HIM
THEN TO THE EGYPTIAN GAVIN SAID FIRMLY
CERTAINLY IT IS GOLD SAID GAVIN EQUALLY STUPID
NOW ALL THIS TIME GAVIN HAD BEEN IN THE DIRE DISTRESS OF A MAN POSSESSED OF TWO MINDS
GAVIN TRIED HONESTLY TO WEIGH THOSE TWO MINDS AGAINST EACH OTHER
I HONOUR GAVIN FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE TOOK THIS WARNING
I DO SAID GAVIN AND WITH THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE
PLUNGING HIS HANDS SO HASTILY INTO HIS POCKETS THAT GAVIN LAUGHED
SHE IS AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO ME AS TO YOU GAVIN ANSWERED
OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED BACK TO THRUMS
THE MINISTER DANCES TO THE WOMAN'S PIPING GAVIN LET THE DOCTOR'S WARNINGS FALL IN THE GRASS
BUT GAVIN ONLY SAW HER IN THE BACKGROUND
NEVER WILL I ATTEMPT TO PICTURE THE EGYPTIAN AS SHE SEEMED TO GAVIN WHILE SHE BENT OVER NANNY'S FIRE
BUT NOW GAVIN WAS ONLY DOING THIS GIRL'S BIDDING
AND GAVIN DREW A LONG FACE
GAVIN RETURNED TO THE FIRE AND WATCHED A GIRL IN IT IN AN OFFICER'S CLOAK PLAYING AT HIDE AND SEEK WITH SOLDIERS
GAVIN LOOKED AT NANNY WITH ADMIRATION AND ENVY
AND GAVIN WAS SO EAGER TO HELP THAT HE BUMPED HIS HEAD ON THE PLATE RACK
TO COVER GAVIN'S CONFUSION
HE IS NOT GAVIN REPLIED
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT INTERPOSED GAVIN
GAVIN WAS TOUCHED
A BISCUIT OF WHICH ONLY THRUMS KNOWS THE SECRET
BUT GAVIN
EVERY TIME GAVIN'S CUP WENT TO HIS LIPS NANNY CALCULATED CORRECTLY HOW MUCH HE HAD DRUNK
FOR THOUGH GAVIN SPOKE FREELY
GAVIN HAD LAID ASIDE THE MINISTER WITH HIS HAT
WITHOUT EVERYBODY IN THRUMS KNOWING ABOUT IT
HOW DO YOU GET TO KNOW ALL THESE THINGS NANNY ASKED GAVIN SIGHING
WHEREUPON GAVIN SUDDENLY BECAME INTERESTED IN THE FLOOR
THEN ANSWERED NANNY TURNING TO GAVIN FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS
IF NANNY HAD NOT TAKEN HER EYES OFF GAVIN FOR THE MOMENT SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS NOW ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE TOPIC
GAVIN WAS IN A QUANDARY
AND GAVIN WAS STILL TREMBLING UNDER THEIR TOUCH
I HOPE THAT IS NOT TRUE GAVIN SAID SIMPLY
ALL AT ONCE IT CAME TO GAVIN THAT THIS FRAGILE GIRL MIGHT HAVE A HISTORY FAR SADDER AND MORE TURBULENT THAN HIS
GAVIN DREW A GREAT BREATH
AND GAVIN SET OFF
AT THIS HOUR ON MONDAY SAID GAVIN
IN THE MEANTIME GAVIN WAS TRUDGING HOME GLOOMILY COMPOSING HIS SECOND SERMON AGAINST WOMEN
WHO POSSESSED THE PIONEER SPRING BED OF THRUMS
GAVIN SAW ONLY DEJECTED FIRS WITH DROPS OF WATER FALLING LISTLESSLY FROM THEM
I SUPPOSE NO YOUNG MAN TO WHOM SOCIETY HAS NOT BECOME A CHEAP THING CAN BE IN GAVIN'S POSITION
NOW GAVIN MADE AN HEROIC ATTEMPT TO LOOK UPON BOTH THESE WOMEN AT ONCE
WHERE ARE YOU CRIED GAVIN IN BEWILDERMENT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE GAVIN SAID WRATHFULLY
COME DOWN AT ONCE ORDERED GAVIN
GAVIN STOOD EXPECTANT
IN FIVE MINUTES ECHOED GAVIN
I WON'T SAID GAVIN SO PROMPTLY THAT SHE WAS PIQUED
YOU KNOW THAT WAS NOT WHAT I MEANT SAID GAVIN STEPPING AFTER HER
DO YOU SAID GAVIN ABSURDLY GRATIFIED
GAVIN'S FINGERS TWITCHED WITH MORTIFICATION
IT IS A TOPIC I WOULD RATHER NOT SPEAK ABOUT GAVIN ANSWERED
THOUGH YOU ARE ONLY A MINIS
GAVIN'S ARMS BUT THEY MET ON NOTHING
HAD DECIDED INSTANTLY TO LINE GAVIN'S WAISTCOAT WITH FLANNEL
FOR SHE HAD AN AMBITION TO BE EVERYTHING SHE THOUGHT GAVIN WOULD LIKE A WOMAN TO BE
BUT THAT GAVIN HAD PRESERVED THE HOLLY BECAUSE OF THE DONOR WAS AS OBVIOUS TO JEAN AS THAT THE VASE IN HER HAND WAS EMPTY
SHE HASTENED BACK TO GAVIN'S ROOM WITH THE VASE
NOW GAVIN HAD ALREADY SMILED SEVERAL TIMES TO JEAN
LOVE LEADING TO A RUPTURE GAVIN TOLD HIMSELF NOT TO GO NEAR THE MUD HOUSE ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
FOR GAVIN QUICKLY TOOK THAT SIDE OF A TREE WHICH IS LOVED OF SQUIRRELS AT THE APPROACH OF AN ENEMY
GAVIN CAME INTO THE OPEN
DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD NO ANSWERED TRUTHFUL GAVIN
GAVIN LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY BUT SHE WAS NOT LAUGHING AT HIM
BUT GAVIN WAS STARTLED
I AM AFRAID OF NOTHING GAVIN ANSWERED OFFENDED IN TURN
FEAR SAID GAVIN IS ONE THING AND PRUDENCE IS ANOTHER
GAVIN BEAT THE BRUSHWOOD MOURNFULLY WITH HIS STAFF
IS THERE AN ENGLISH CHURCH DENOMINATION GAVIN GROANED
IN WHAT WAY GAVIN KNEW WHAT WAY VERY WELL
OR GO CRAZY HER VEHEMENCE ALARMED GAVIN
WE SHALL NOT QUARREL SAID GAVIN DECIDEDLY
DO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU HAD IT ON YOUR FINGER YOU WOULD BE MORE WORTH ROBBING THAN WITH EIGHTY POUNDS IN EACH OF YOUR POCKETS WHERE DID YOU GET IT DEMANDED GAVIN
TELL ME HOW YOU GOT IT GAVIN INSISTED HIS FACE NOW HARD
DID GAVIN MAKE THIS DISCOVERY WHEN THE EGYPTIAN LEFT HIM
IN THE BELIEF THAT GAVIN HAD GONE
WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE ASKED GAVIN
THAT WAS ALL I HAD TO SAY CONCLUDED GAVIN
GAVIN WAS DISTRACTED
AND GAVIN HASTENED TO ANSWER
GAVIN BEGAN TO BE LESS DISPLEASED WITH HIMSELF
WHY SHOULD YOU TELL ME CRIED GAVIN HIS HAND RISING TO STOP HER
IT IS MY TURN NOW TO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO YOU EXCLAIMED GAVIN
IT WAS BOYISH BUT I AM GLAD GAVIN SAID IT
FOR CERTAINLY THE SCANDAL DID NOT SPREAD IN THRUMS
GAVIN'S FUTURE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT
THAT THRUMS MIGHT NEVER KNOW IT
I SUPPOSE HE FEARED TO SPEAK TO GAVIN
AND HE MADE AN OPPORTUNITY OF INVITING GAVIN INTO THE SURGERY
BUT TO ME AND MANY OTHERS A ROOM THAT SMELLED OF HEARSES
AFTER HE AND GAVIN HAD TALKED A LITTLE WHILE
DID I EVER ADVISE YOU TO SMOKE IT IS YOUR USUAL FORM OF SALUTATION GAVIN ANSWERED
AND THAT YOU MERELY WEAR IT FROM HABIT TUTS ANSWERED THE DOCTOR
BUT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE WAYS OF THE FLEDGELINGS
GAVIN HOWEVER DID NOT EVEN BLINK
I KNOW SHE HEARD THAT THE SOLDIERS WERE COMING TO THRUMS BEFORE THEY KNEW OF THEIR DESTINATION THEMSELVES
THEY WERE THRUMS FOLK
SHE IS A WOMAN SAID GAVIN
PERHAPS GAVIN'S FACE WAS WHITER AS HE LEFT THE HOUSE THAN WHEN HE ENTERED IT
GAVIN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE SURGERY
BUT GAVIN HAD SEEN THAT THE OBJECT WAS AN OPEN LOCKET
TO SPEAK MORE RATIONALLY GAVIN TOLD HIM WHY HE HAD COME BACK
YOU SELFISH MOTHER GAVIN SAID SMILING
HOW MOTHER ASKED GAVIN SURPRISED
MAY SHE BE FORGIVEN FOR THAT GAVIN EXCLAIMED MARGARET
GAVIN WHAT IS IT A WOMAN THINKS ABOUT THE DAY HER SON IS BORN
IT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE GAVIN REPLIED
GAVIN WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED MUCH HAD HE EVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING
BUT GAVIN WAS THINKING OF HIS OWN AFFAIRS
AY GAVIN SAID MARGARET EARNESTLY
YOUR FACE HAS HELPED ME MORE THAN HEBREW MOTHER REPLIED GAVIN
AS FOR THAT GAVIN SAID
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE YOU SAID GAVIN
PERHAPS GAVIN SAID DOUBTFULLY
OF COURSE SAID GAVIN
I WOULD BROOK NO INTERFERENCE FROM MY SESSION SAID GAVIN
YOU CAN PITY THEM GAVIN SAID MARGARET WITHOUT MARRYING THEM
IT IS HARMLESS GAVIN ANSWERED GOING TO THE WINDOW
GOOD NIGHT GAVIN
IN HONOUR OF THE LITTLE MINISTER SHE HAD BEGUN HER BIBLE AFRESH WHEN HE CAME TO THRUMS
AS GAVIN FELT HIS WAY DOWN THE DARK STAIR
THEN THE LANTERN'S FLASH MET HIM
WHAT IS IT GAVIN ASKED
AND SHE TURNED FROM GAVIN
IT WAS NOTHING BUT A LOVE OF MISCHIEF THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE GAVIN ASKED
I CARE WHAT THEY THINK OF YOU GAVIN SAID
SINCE A MINUTE AGO GAVIN REPLIED WHEN YOU LET ME KISS YOU
NOT TO NIGHT SAID GAVIN
THAT I HAD TRUDGED INTO THRUMS SO LATE
IT WAS REVERENCE FOR GAVIN THAT CHECKED THE LIE
IT IS NATURAL GAVIN SAID
IT WAS WITH THESE CRUEL WORDS THAT GAVIN ADDRESSED ME
THAT GAVIN WAS HOLDING HIS HEAD HIGH AND WAITING FOR ME TO SAY MY WORST
AND I WAS AGAIN TIMID WHEN I SOUGHT TO LET GAVIN SEE THAT MY FAITH IN HIM WAS UNSHAKEN
TO GAVIN HE HAD GIVEN SOMETHING OF HIMSELF
IT WAS BUT LITTLE OF HIS MASTER THAT WAS IN GAVIN
AT WHICH GIRLS OF SIX ARE TRUSTIER HANDS THAN BOYS OF TWELVE
SINCE OUR MEETING SIX MONTHS EARLIER ON THE HILL I HAD NOT SEEN GAVIN
I WAS AWARE THAT SHE LOVED GAVIN AND THAT HE LOVED HER
AND THAT LOVER WAS GAVIN
WHAT COULD I DO TO KEEP GAVIN AND THE WOMAN APART
AND I QUESTIONED IF EVEN THE SAVING OF GAVIN COULD DESTROY THE BITTERNESS OF THAT
WERE SHE AND GAVIN MEETING STILL
MY ANXIETY ABOUT GAVIN CAME BACK TO ME UNTIL I WAS LIKE A MAN IMPRISONED BETWEEN WALLS OF HIS OWN BUILDING
NOW SEEING GAVIN PAY THE PENALTY OF MARRYING THE EGYPTIAN
NEVER SINCE HAVE I WALKED BETWEEN THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND THRUMS IN SO SHORT A TIME
GAVIN'S DEATH HAD STRUCK ME HARD BUT IT DID NOT CRUSH ME
WHERE MARGARET SAT WEEPING OVER THE BODY OF GAVIN
HERE GAVIN AND SHE HAD MET FIRST
AND I HAD TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THRUMS
YES AND THIRSTIER
BUT TO GAVIN I ONLY ANSWERED
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN HER SINCE THAT NIGHT GAVIN ASKED ME
THAT CALLS ME TO THE MEETING FOR RAIN GAVIN SAID
GAVIN WAS TO BE SATISFIED IF HE WERE TOLD THAT NO EVIL HAD BEFALLEN HER HE LOVED
THE EGYPTIAN HAD GONE ON HER KNEES WHEN SHE HEARD GAVIN SPEAK OF HER
WHAT OF THAT CRIED GAVIN
WHO WERE YOUR PARENTS GAVIN ASKED WITHOUT LOOKING UP
BUT SURELY GAVIN SAID
HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO YOU SAID GAVIN
AND WHEN WAS IT YOU BECAME BEAUTIFUL AGAIN GAVIN ASKED
I DARE SAY HE CARES FOR YOU MORE THAN YOU THINK GAVIN SAID GRAVELY
AS WELL AS THE NASTIEST
CAME AS FAR AS THE PLATE AND SIGNED TO PETER TOSH
HENDRY HE PLEADED
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY TOSH ASKED NERVOUSLY
PETER TOSH DO YOUR DUTY
AND WHEN TOSH JOINED HIS FELLOW ELDERS THE PEOPLE WERE COLLECTING IN ANIMATED GROUPS IN THE SQUARE
DEAR GAVIN ANSWERED RESOLUTELY
GAVIN BROKE THROUGH THE DARKNESS BETWEEN THEM AND HIM
GAVIN HEARD HER CRY AND RAN BACK TO THE ENCAMPMENT
IN THE RINGING OF THE TEN O'CLOCK BELL GAVIN HAD LIVED THE SEVENTH PART OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE
GAVIN WAS IN IT ON A NIGHT THAT TRIED US REPEATEDLY FOR QUITE HALF THAT TIME
GAVIN HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SNAP CREPT TIMIDLY TOWARD HIM
THIS WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE THEY HAD ANY RAIN IN THRUMS
AND LEGEND SAID THAT IT WOULD ONE DAY FALL FORWARD AND SQUIRT ALL THE WATER INTO THE GLEN
I STEPPED OVER IT AND RAN ON RECKLESSLY TO GAVIN
OR IF IT WAS ONLY THAT THE EARS GROW USED TO DINS AS THE EYES DISTINGUISH THE OBJECTS IN A ROOM THAT IS AT FIRST BLACK TO THEM
PROBABLY GAVIN'S LIFE DEPENDED ON HIS SLEEPING
AND THAT GAVIN IN A FRENZY HAD FOLLOWED THEM
IT WILL BE AT A COST YOU CANNOT ESTIMATE TILL YOU RETURN TO THRUMS
STONED FROM THRUMS
AND SINCE SHE CAME TO THRUMS MY ONE CARE HAS BEEN TO KEEP MY EXISTENCE FROM HER
GAVIN LOOKING AT ME
AND I DID NOT LOOK AT GAVIN
WHY YOU WERE CALLED GAVIN YES HE ANSWERED
IT WAS BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT GAVIN A PRETTIER NAME THAN ADAM
NO I SAID SLOWLY IT WAS BECAUSE GAVIN IS MY NAME
AFTER GAVIN HAD SAID SOME BOYISH THINGS THAT WERE OF NO AVAIL TO ME
I WAS FINGERING THE THING GRIMLY WHEN GAVIN'S EYE FELL ON SOMETHING ELSE IN THE DESK
KIDDY CATCH THE KNIFE
HAVING FINISHED MY TALE I TURNED TO GAVIN FOR SYMPATHY
I WAS SOURED TO SEE GAVIN PROVE THIS
NOW GAVIN MUST SEE THE WISDOM OF MY REASONING
I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD THAT YOU WHO READ WOULD FOLLOW GAVIN NOW RATHER THAN ME
NEXT DAY HE RETURNED BOASTFULLY TO LOOK AT HIS JUMP
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRAWING NEAR THRUMS
IT HAD SCARCELY KEPT PACE WITH GAVIN
THEN TIE UP THE BELL AT ONCE HENDRY I URGED
HENDRY I SAID RISING I MUST SEE THIS LADY AT ONCE
AND SO PRESERVED PROOF OF WHAT HE WAS PERJURING HIMSELF TO DENY
AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS SHEER LOVE OF THEM THAT FIRST MADE HER PLAY THE COQUETTE WITH GAVIN
SHE UNDERESTIMATED HIS DANGER
AND THE LADDIES ARE TOSSING THEIR BONNETS IN THE AIR
AND GAVIN KNEW IT
IS THERE SOME ONE IN DANGER ASKED GAVIN
BUT IN THAT MOVEMENT GAVIN HAD SEEN TWICE
POOR BRUTE SAID THE SHEPHERD AND LOOKED WITH AWE AT GAVIN
THAT KEPT THE WORDS IN GAVIN'S MOUTH FOR HALF A MINUTE
BUT WAS IT BRAVE OF GAVIN TO JUMP
HOW DID I FIND YOU IT WAS I WHO FOUND YOU GAVIN ANSWERED
ACROSS THAT THUNDERING WATER ONLY GAVIN'S VOICE COULD CARRY
IF THEY COULD HEAR THE LITTLE MINISTER'S WORD GAVIN CAUGHT THE GESTICULATING EARL BY THE SLEEVE
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT I COULD DOUBT HER GAVIN SAID COMPASSIONATELY
BUT THE FORCE OF THE RIVER HAD BEEN UNDERESTIMATED
GAVIN SEIZED THE ROPE
SOME OF THE PARTY ON THE BANK BEGAN HASTILY TO IMPROVISE A ROPE OF CRAVATS AND THE TAGS OF THE ROPES STILL LEFT
THE PEOPLE HAD GIVEN UP ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH GAVIN SAVE BY SIGNS
WE MUST PREPARE FOR DEATH GAVIN SAID SOLEMNLY TO THE EARL
GAVIN TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS POCKET AND HE SAID
AND HANDED TO PETER TOSH
TO MISTER OGILVY GAVIN CONTINUED YOU WILL ALSO GIVE THE CHAIN
IT WAS THEN THAT GAVIN PAUSED
BUT THE TWO MEN WERE NOT YET GONE AND GAVIN SPOKE ONCE MORE
AND THOSE WHO HAD COURAGE TO LOOK SAW GAVIN PRAYING WITH THE EARL
WHO SAVED GAVIN'S LIFE
GAVIN WAS NEVER AGAIN ABLE TO LIFT HIS LEFT HAND HIGHER THAN HIS HEAD
A SHARP TUG AT THE CORD UNTIES THE FOOL'S KNOT
FOR I FELT AS IF I WAS SKEWERED UP IN A STRAIGHT JACKET
THE COURT DEPRESSOR REPROVED THEM STERNLY
I CAN ONLY RECOLLECT ONE VERSE OF THIS SOLEMN CHANT OF THE COURT DEPRESSOR
FOR THE EARLESS MAN IN MUSIC'S REALM
BUT THE FAIR AND CUNNING RESULT OF THE METAL WORKER'S SKILL
I TOUCHED TAP HARD'S HEART TO THANK HIM
WHICH POURS ITS SPLENDOR WITH UNSTINTING HAND UPON THE WIDE HIGHWAYS
AND AS THE SOFT RADIANCE OF THE ALABASTER LAMPS FELL UPON THESE MAGNIFICENT PELTS AND SET TEN THOUSAND JEWELS IN THE WALLS AND CEILINGS OF ICE
THE WALLS LINED WITH BROAD DIVANS COVERED WITH SNOW WHITE PELTS
AND NOT TO ASK THEM ANY POSERS
STILL INDULGED THE BELIEF THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE IN THE END TO REFRIGERATE HIM
HE CONCEIVED A GENUINE AFFECTION FOR ME AND SENT SEVERAL MAGNIFICENT PELTS TO THE ICE HOUSE
AND MAGNIFICENT PELTS OF BEAR AND SEAL AND WALRUS
HE MERELY ORDERED HIM TO BE REFRIGERATED FOR SO MANY HOURS A DAY UNTIL ALL HIS FEVERISH PROJECTS HAD BEEN CHILLED TO DEATH
AND WITH AN ICY SMILE SPOKE FROSTILY AS FOLLOWS
AND THE ROYAL DIVANS WERE LAID WITH THE RICHEST PELTS IN THE PALACE
AND PILLOWING MY POOR ACHING HEAD ON A CUSHION
FOR THEY TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN PROVING TO THE LISTENER THAT THEY DESERVE THE NAME OF RATTLEBRAIN
THERE WAS NOT ONE DISSENTIENT VOICE
I HAD BLUBBERED TILL MY EYES WERE SO RED AND SWOLLEN
AND THE OTHER HALF THREW INTO THE WAITER'S FACE
AND TOLD ME THAT ALL THE MIDSHIPMEN RESORTED TO THAT HOTEL
FOR THERE'S ONLY THREE MIDSHIPMEN IN THE SHIP NOW
HE IS A SPUNKY FELLOW AND I'LL BE HIS SECOND
WHERE I FOUND ALL THE MIDSHIPMEN AND SOME OF THE WAITERS OF THE INN
RELATED ALL THAT THE MIDSHIPMEN HAD TOLD ME
WHICH THEY WERE SWABBING DRY
I MET ONE OF THE MIDSHIPMEN WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN IN COMPANY AT THE BLUE POSTS
ALTHOUGH THEY SCUFFLED AS MUCH AS BEFORE
THE CURSED DRUNKEN OLD CATAMARAN CRIED HE
HE THEN SENT FOR ALL THE MIDSHIPMEN ON THE QUARTER DECK
WHEN THE MIDSHIPMEN WENT DOWN BELOW THEY ALL SHOOK HANDS WITH ME
BUT ONE OF THE MIDSHIPMEN OFFERED TO ACCOMPANY ME
THE MIDSHIPMAN TOLD ME THESE WERE CALLED THE CAT HARPINGS
WE WERE ORDERED TO THE DOCKYARD TO DRAW SEA STORES
CAPTAIN MCALPINE
OR ANY OTHER EXPENSES WHICH YOU MAY CONSIDER WARRANTABLE OR JUSTIFIABLE
FIRST WE WENT INTO RICHARDSON'S
THE SEAMEN OF THE MERCHANT SHIPS HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH BLUDGEONS AND OTHER WEAPONS
AND THIS PERSUADER WAS SELDOM IDLE
THEY'LL THRIVE UPON TOBACCO UNTIL THEY GROW AS LARGE AS CONGER EELS
AND WANT NO ABSOLUTION FROM FATHER MCGRATH
IMMEDIATELY DISUNITES THEM
MR CHUCKS
ALTHOUGH ALL THE REST OF THE MIDSHIPMEN HAD BUT ONE SERVANT BETWEEN THEM
THAT I SHOULD HAVE LAID ASIDE MY DIGNITY AND MIDSHIPMAN'S DRESS
THAT I MIGHT REGULATE MY COMPORTMENT BY THAT OF GOOD SOCIETY
THERE I WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP AND MADE A PRISONER BY A FLATFISH
AND SEE HOW FAR THE LAND TRENDS FORWARD
DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND BETWEEN THE O'BRIENS
MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH CELESTE AND NOW I HAVE TO RELATE AN EVENT
THAT O'BRIEN SHOWED GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND IN SPIKING THE LAST GUN
CELESTE SAID HE YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE ENGLISH
CELESTE WENT OUT
AND WALKED ABOUT WITH CELESTE
I PROMISED TO WRITE TO CELESTE
THE ANSWER FROM CELESTE WAS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH
WHEN A STEEL'S LIST WAS SENT TO A LIEUTENANT
CELESTE THEN RETIRED FROM THE WINDOW
AND I FROM TOULOUSE
O'BRIEN THEN PULLED OUT THE FIFTY NAPOLEONS GIVEN US BY CELESTE
AND ANOTHER FROM ME TO DEAR LITTLE CELESTE
THE MIDSHIPMEN PASSED THE NEEDLE FROM WATCH TO WATCH
AND THE PURSERS STEWARD
AND THAT THE MARINE OFFICER HAD GONE TO STONEHOUSE TO SEE HIS WIFE
ONE OF THE MIDSHIPMEN WAS MAST HEADED BY THE SECOND LIEUTENANT
AND WRITE TO FATHER MCGRATH
FATHER MCGRATH MUST HAVE ALL PARTICULARS
I NEVER CAN FORGET THE SENSATION OF ADMIRATION WHICH I FELT ON CLOSING WITH NEEDHAM POINT TO ENTER CARLISLE BAY
OUR FIRST BUSINESS WAS TO WATER THE SHIP BY RAFTING AND TOWING OFF THE CASKS
I SLIPPED AWAY WITH THREE OTHER MIDSHIPMEN AND WE SOON ARRIVED THERE
ADDED TO HIS LIEUTENANT'S EPAULET AND HANDSOME PERSON
THE SEAMEN CLOSING UP THE REAR WITH THEIR STRETCHERS
AND THE BLUNTNESS WITH WHICH HE USED TO CONTRADICT AND ASSERT HIS DISBELIEF OF CAPTAIN KEARNEY'S NARRATIVES OFTEN PRODUCED A COOLNESS BETWEEN THEM FOR SOME DAYS
THAT ALMOST EVERY SACRIFICE WAS WARRANTABLE FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY
HE WOULD NOT TRUST ANY OF THE MIDSHIPMEN ON SO DANGEROUS A SERVICE
BUT AS THE DONS DID NOT SEEM AT ALL INCLINED TO COME OUT AND HAVE A BRUSH WITH US
BUT PRIDE'S A FINE HORSE
BY THIS TIME WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH UNRIGGED AS IF WE HAD BEEN TWO DAYS PAYING OFF IN PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR
AND SWAB THE BLOOD FROM THE DECKS
MY THREE FARMS IN THE VALE OF AYLESBURY
I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT FATHER MCGRATH AND I HAVE BEEN DOING
IT DETHRONES THE ALMIGHTY
IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE WHO PROTEST BEFOREHAND THAT THEY ARE INFIDELS OR AGNOSTICS
AND HIS OATH IS CONSIDERED INVALIDATED
FROM DISLIKING THEM IN THEMSELVES
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT INTELLIGENT MEN DO NOT OPPOSE AN INSTITUTION AS VENERABLE AS MONASTICISM WITHOUT REASONS
SCANDALMONGERS AND DISHONEST CRITICS NOTED THE CHARGES
THERE IS HERE NONE OF THE ARROGANCE AND SELFISHNESS THAT USUALLY CHARACTERIZE THE POSSESSION OF WEALTH TO THE EMBITTERMENT OF MISERY AND MISFORTUNE
IT CANNOT VALIDLY BIND ONE TO VIOLATE THE LAWS OF STATE ANY MORE THAN TO VIOLATE THE LAW OF GOD
HE WHO ACTS THUS INVOKES A SPIRIT OF EVIL
IS NATURALLY MEASURED BY THE DEGREE OF ADVERTENCE POSSESSED BY SUCH PERSONS
THIS BRINGS US TO CONSIDER CERTAIN EJACULATORY OR EXCLAMATORY EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS
CHARITY OVERRIDES EVERY LAW FOR IT IS ITSELF THE FIRST LAW OF GOD
AND WITHOUT ENTHUSING OVER THE FACT
ITS BOND HAS LOST ITS CHARACTER OF INDISSOLUBILITY AND ITS OBLIGATIONS ARE SHIRKED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF FASHION AND CONVENIENCE
HOWEVER THEOLOGICALLY UNSOUND THIS PROPOSITION MAY APPEAR
BELITTLES DIGNITY AND CONSIDERS PARENTS BENEATH ESTEEM
AND NO CONSIDERATION UNDER HEAVEN WILL BE EQUAL TO THE TASK OF INSTILLING AFFECTION INTO A STONE OR A CHUNK OF PUTTY
IT CAN OCCUR ONLY IN THE EVENT OF PARENTS OVERRIDING THE LAW THAT GOVERNS THEIR STATION IN LIFE
THIS IS A MATTER THAT DEPENDS ON PERSONAL TASTES AND THE INNER VOICINGS OF THE SPIRIT
IS NOT DIRECTED THE MORALIST'S UNMEASURED CENSURE
YOU ARE THEREFORE NOT UNDERPAID
THIS ARTIFICE IS CALLED EQUIVOCATION OR AMPHIBOLOGY
OR A PRIEST WITH KNOWLEDGE SAFEGUARDED BY THE SEAL OF THE CONFESSIONAL
THEIR STANDING AS PROFESSIONAL MEN PUTS EVERY QUESTIONER ON HIS GUARD AND ADMONISHES HIM THAT NO PRIVATE INFORMATION NEED BE EXPECTED
BUT THE KILLING OF THE VICTIM IN NOWISE EXTINGUISHES THE OBLIGATION OF REPARATION
BY ATTENUATING AS FAR AS TRUTH WILL ALLOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE
ITS FAITH MUST BE SAFEGUARDED
INCRIMINATES AS WELL AS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION
THE MOMENT A PERSON SHIRKS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF REFUNDING THE POSSESSIONS
WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE AND INSOLVABLE DOUBT AS TO THE AMOUNT OF REPARATION TO BE MADE
ONE A TALL YOUNG FELLOW LOOKS AT A DISTANCE LIKE A FIELD OFFICER IN A FLASHY UNIFORM BUT IS ONLY AN ENGLISH FOOTMAN IN A GAUDY LIVERY WHO NEEDS THE TRAINING OF A LONDON WINTER OR TWO IN A FASHIONABLE HOUSEHOLD TO MAKE HIM A FLUNKY OF THE FIRST WATER
MAJOR WARREN WAS PROVOKED AT THE GENERAL ADMIRATION OF CRANFIELD'S TASTE AND SKILL AND STUNG BY THE REPEATED THANKS WITH WHICH LADY MABEL REPAID HIS LABORS SO HE ENDEAVORED TO TURN THEM INTO RIDICULE
CRANFIELD WAS ABOUT TO MAKE ANGRY ANSWER BUT LADY MABEL ANTICIPATED HIM BY SAYING
I WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT ADDED SHE IN A COMMISERATING TONE
FOR WE SEE IN THE BAKER'S NAME STAMPED ON THE LOAVES FOUND IN POMPEII AND WORDS IMPRESSED ON THEIR POTTERY AND OTHER ARTICLES WHAT AMOUNTS TO STEREOTYPE PRINTING
DISLIKING HOWEVER TO MAKE ONE OF AN ADMIRING CROWD HE SHOWED HIS STRATEGY IN CHOOSING WELL HIS TIME AND CALLED ON LADY MABEL ON THE DAY AND AT THE HOUR WHEN AN INSPECTION OF THE TROOPS HAVING BEEN ORDERED EVERY OFFICER WAS AT HIS POST EXCEPT HIMSELF
IS IT NOT POSITIVE TREASON TO AID AND ABET THE KING'S ENEMIES
THE REGIMENTAL BUSINESS WAS SOON DISPATCHED AND THE ADJUTANT WHO WAS A CAPITAL NEWSMONGER BEGAN TO DETAIL THE LOCAL NEWS OF THE DAY
ITS WATERS ARE OF SO PETRIFYING A QUALITY THAT THE WHEELS OF THE MILLS IT WORKS ARE SAID TO BE SOON TURNED INTO STONE
THE BOTANIC GARDEN
HE CAN BE CHARGED WITH NO SHORTCOMINGS FOR HE OVERDOES ALL HE UNDERTAKES
THOSE SHADOWS WE CALL FRIENDS ATTEND US THROUGH THE SUNSHINE OF SUCCESS TO VANISH IN ADVERSITY'S DARK HOUR
IN THE NARROW VALLEY OVERGROWN WITH SHRUBS AND BRUSHWOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL THEY CAME SUDDENLY ON A LARGE NUMBER OF SWINE LUXURIATING IN THE COOL WATERS OR ON THE SHADY BANKS OF A BROOK
CARRIED OFF AND KEPT A PRISONER IN FRANCE TO BE BULLIED THREATENED AND CAJOLED WITH A VIEW TO APPROPRIATE THE PAPAL INFLUENCE TO THE FURTHERANCE OF THIS CORSICAN'S AMBITION
IN OBEDIENCE TO THE IMPERIAL DECREE ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER OF THE CHURCHES CHAPELS AND FRATERNITIES OF THE CITY WERE CARRIED OFF TO THE MINT
THE BEST EXCUSE THAT CAN BE MADE FOR THEIR PLUNDERINGS IS THAT IN THE CONFUSION OF THEIR OWN REVOLUTION THEY SO COMPLETELY LOST THE IDEA OF PROPERTY THAT THOUGH THEY HAVE RECOVERED THE THING THEY HAVE NOT YET REMASTERED THE IDEA OF IT
AND HERE THEY CLAIM THE RIGHT OF TARRYING THREE DAYS IF THEY LIKE IT
THEIR PATH BENDING WESTWARD THEY NOW SAW CLOUDS MUSTERING ON THE HEIGHTS BEFORE THEM AND ONE OF APRIL'S SUDDEN SHOWERS DRAWING NEAR
HE MADE THEM GATHER UP THE PILE OF FLAX WITH THE SPINDLES AND DISTAFFS NOW LYING IDLE ON THE FLOOR AND INVITED THE LADIES TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CUSHIONS WHICH AFTER A MOORISH CUSTOM STILL LINGERING HERE THE GIRLS HAD USED AS SEATS
A TOPOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF HALF A DOZEN SHIRES A GENERAL NOTION OF THE SHAPE OF OLD SCOTLAND AND A HAZY OUTLINE OF THE SISTER KINGDOM MADE UP ALL HE HAD ATTAINED TO
THE WINE BEING OLD MILD AND DELICATE IN FLAVOR HE CLASSED IT IN THE SAME CATEGORY WITH SMALL BEER FAR UNDERRATING ITS BEGUILING POTENCY
THERE IS IN EVERY COUNTRY A CLASS WHO ARE PRONE TO DENATIONALIZE THEMSELVES
BUT IF THERE IS ANY ONE WHOM I FEEL AT LIBERTY TO DESPISE AND DISTRUST IT IS A GERMAN SPANIARD OR ENGLISHMAN WHO IS TRYING TO FRENCHIFY HIMSELF
HIS LORDSHIP PROFESSED TO DETECT NOT ONLY IN THE ACT ITSELF BUT IN THE MODUS OPERANDI INFALLIBLE MARKS THAT FATHERED IT ON THE SPANIARD
THEY HAVE TOO OFTEN SHOWN THEIR PATRIOTISM BY MURDERING THEIR GENERALS UNDERRATING THEIR ENEMIES AND SLIGHTING THEIR FRIENDS
SPAIN IS A CONVENIENT FIELD ON WHICH TO DRUB THE FRENCH
I TRUST THEY ARE SAID CRANFIELD WITH A SNEER
THE HEAT OF THE CLIMATE DISCOURAGES EXERCISE ON FOOT SAID LADY MABEL
AND I WILL NOT HAVE HIM SO TRADUCED
BE IT SO REPLIED CRANFIELD
HE TOLD SOME CURIOUS AND THRILLING INCIDENTS BUT HIS PROFESSION GETTING THE MASTERY OF HIM HE SOON GOT TO THE HOSPITAL AND AMIDST GHASTLY WOUNDS HORRID DISFIGURATIONS AND DISMEMBERED LIMBS BEGAN TO BANDAGE SLASH AND SAW UNTIL LADY MABEL SICKENED AT THE TALE
PRESENTLY FINDING THEMSELVES ALMOST ALONE THEY FOLLOWED THEIR COMPANIONS TO THE BRIDGE HEAD AND JOINED THE LARGE COMPANY ASSEMBLED IN THIS OUTWORK
THE LEVEL SPACE WITHIN THIS OUTWORK WAS NOW CROWDED WITH COUPLES THE PORTUGUESE LADIES ENTERING FULLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUR
AS TO THEIR LOVE OF DANCING AND OF THE FANDANGO IN PARTICULAR IT IS SAID THOUGH I DO NOT VOUCH FOR IT THAT THE CHURCH OF ROME SCANDALIZED THAT A COUNTRY SO RENOWNED FOR THE PURITY OF ITS FAITH HAD NOT LONG AGO PROSCRIBED SO PROFANE A DANCE RESOLVED TO PRONOUNCE THE SOLEMN CONDEMNATION OF IT
HE ORDERED HIS MEN TO FORM ON THE EDGE OF THE WATER FRONTING THE FORD TO UNBUCKLE THEIR CLOAKS AND THROW THEM OVER THEIR HELMETS AND NOT TO MOVE OR SPEAK A WORD
IN INSPIRATION'S HAPPIEST MOOD SHE TRIED AGAIN AND MOULDED YOU
A MERE VERSIFIER WOULD HAVE LIKENED A LADY'S EYES TO EARTHLY DIAMONDS OR HEAVENLY STARS
FOR THE ENGLISH OFFICERS ALWAYS PROFESSING THE UTMOST READINESS TO PUNISH THE OFFENCES OF THEIR MEN WERE SINGULARLY SCRUPULOUS AND EXACTING AS TO THE CONCLUSIVENESS OF THE PROOFS OF GUILT
FOR MY METHOD LOOKING TO THE SPIRIT NOT THE LETTER OF THE LAW DISCOURAGES IT GREATLY
FATHER BERET SEEMED NOT LOATH TO ENTER ALBEIT HE OFFERED A WEAK PROTEST AGAINST DELAYING SOME TASK HE HAD IN HAND
BUT WHAT IF A TOURIST WITH ONE IN HAND COULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO TAKE A SNAPSHOT AT THE PRIEST AND THE MAIDEN AS THEY WALKED ARM IN ARM TO THAT SQUAT LITTLE VERANDA
TRUE ENOUGH FATHER BERET TRUE ENOUGH SHE RESPONDED LAUGHING YOUR PERCEPTION IS MOST EXCELLENT WHICH I WILL PROVE TO YOU IMMEDIATELY
INTOXICANTS WERE THE ONLY POPULAR SPECIFIC
WE NEED NOT WONDER THEN WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT FATHER BERET MADE NO SIGN OF DISTRESS OR DISAPPROVAL UPON BEING INFORMED OF THE ARRIVAL OF A BOAT LOADED WITH RUM BRANDY OR GIN
FATHER BERET TOOK THE LETTER WITHOUT APPARENT INTEREST AND SAID
AH THE POOR SOULS SIGHED FATHER BERET SPEAKING AS ONE WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE WANDERING FAR AWAY
YOU WILL NOT DRINK ANY TO NIGHT MY SON FATHER BERET ADDED
BUT IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO RESIST FATHER BERET WHOM HE LOVED AS DID EVERY SOUL IN THE POST
FATHER BERET'S FACE AND VOICE CHANGED ON THE INSTANT
FATHER BERET GAZED AFTER HIM HIS FACE RELAXING TO A SERIOUS EXPRESSION IN WHICH A TRACE OF SADNESS AND GLOOM SPREAD LIKE AN ELUSIVE TWILIGHT
IF FATHER BERET HEARD IT HE GAVE NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION
FATHER BERET WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO FLATTER ME
EATING'S BETTER THAN TALKING YOU KNOW
BUT HER IMAGINATION WAS OUTGROWING HER SURROUNDINGS
THE RIVER HOUSE WAS BEGINNING ITS CAROUSAL WITH A SONG
HIS SIXTY YEARS OF EXPOSURE HARDSHIP AND DANGER SEEMED TO HAVE BUT TOUGHENED HIS PHYSIQUE AND STRENGTHENED HIS VITALITY
HIS AIR WOULD BE REGARDED AS VIOLENTLY BRIGANDISH IN OUR DAY
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS ELEMENTARY MAGNETISM AUGMENTED THE FLOW OF HIS FINE DESCRIPTIONS AND HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF FATHER BERET PUT AN END TO IT ALL
I AM UNDER MANY OBLIGATIONS MY SON SAID FATHER BERET FOR WHAT YOU TELL ME
HIS VOICE QUAVERS WHENEVER HE SPEAKS OF YOU
THE MARK IS QUITE INVISIBLE THEREFORE SO FAR AS FATHER BERET IS CONCERNED YOU NEVER TOLD ME OF YOUR BIRTH MARK BEFORE MY DAUGHTER SAID FATHER BERET TURNING TO ALICE WITH SUDDEN INTEREST
RENE'S BROWN FACE FLUSHED TO THE TEMPLES PARTLY WITH ANGER PARTLY WITH THE SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND FEAR
HE HE SNICKERED AS IF THE FACT WERE A MOST ENJOYABLE JOKE
HE WONDERED AT HER INFLUENCE OVER FATHER BERET WHOM SHE CONTROLLED APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT
THE HUNGRIEST PART OF HER MIND WAS BEING SUMPTUOUSLY BANQUETED AT HIS EXPENSE
BUT YOU WILL FEEL BETTER AT LAST WHEN ALL IS OVER AND THE STING OF DEFEAT TINGLES THROUGH YOU IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF HAVING USED EVERY SENSIBLE PRECAUTION
SHE LED THE WAY TO A PLEASANT LITTLE COURT IN THE REAR OF THE CABIN'S YARD A SPACE BETWEEN TWO WINGS AND A VINE COVERED TRELLIS BEYOND WHICH LAY A WELL KEPT VINEYARD AND VEGETABLE GARDEN
AFTER THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TRADING EXPERIENCE OF ALL HIS LIFE HE FELT IRREPRESSIBLY LIBERAL
WHY NOT DRINK EXHILARATING TODDIES
GO TO FATHER BERET TELL HIM EVERYTHING AND THEN ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS SHE SAID IN A CALM EVEN TONE HER FACE GROWING SERIOUS
HE WAS NOTHING IF NOT A DEVOUT CATHOLIC AND HIS CONSCIENCE ROOTED ITSELF IN WHAT GOOD FATHER BERET HAD TAUGHT HIM
FATHER BERET WAS THE HUMBLE SELF EFFACING NEVER TIRING AGENT OF GOOD IN HIS COMMUNITY
THE CROWD PROVING TOO GREAT FOR THE BUILDING'S CAPACITY AS THERE HAD TO BE AMPLE SPACE FOR THE DANCERS
I THINK YOU MIGHT TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED SAID ADRIENNE POUTING AND STILL PLUCKING AT HIS ARM
HE HARDLY COULD HAVE BEEN SURE WHICH WAS MASTER HER SERENITY OR HER GIRLISH DELIGHT IN BEING ATTRACTIVELY DRESSED
FATHER BERET WAS PRESENT SHARING HEARTILY IN THE MERRIMENT OF HIS FLOCK
FATHER BERET UNDERSTOOD THE CONDITIONS AROUND HIM AND HAD THE GENIUS TO KNOW WHAT NOT TO HEAR WHAT NOT TO SEE
HE MET FATHER BERET AND PASSED A FEW PLEASANT WORDS WITH HIM
HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED ALL THE TIME ABOUT HELM'S UTTER LACK OF MILITARY PRECAUTION
FATHER BERET TOLD ME NOT TO FORGET MY DIGNITY WHEN IN YOUR COMPANY
HELM'S FACE WAS CONGESTED WITH EXCITEMENT
THE FRENCH GAVE YOU THIS POST ON EASY TERMS CAPTAIN BLANDLY RETORTED FATHER BERET
HE GLANCED ABOUT WITH FURTIVE SHIFTY EYES GRIMACED AND WINKED AFTER THE MANNER OF AN ANIMAL JUST WAKING FROM A LAZY NAP
THEN SHE LAUGHED OUT OF THE DEPTH OF HER HOOD A PERFECTLY MERRY LAUGH BUT NOT IN THE LEAST FLATTERING TO CAPTAIN FARNSWORTH'S VANITY
THE FLAG IS UNDER FATHER BERET'S FLOOR SHE SAID
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN BUT FATHER BERET WAS NOT INSIDE
FARNSWORTH HEARD HER UTTER A LOW CRY OF SURPRISE OR DISMAY AND WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING IN WHEN FATHER BERET COMING AROUND THE CORNER OF THE CABIN CONFRONTED HIM
SHE SCREAMED SHARPLY AND FATHER BERET WHO WAS COMING OUT OF A CABIN NOT FAR AWAY HEARD AND KNEW THE VOICE
FATHER BERET
BEVERLEY'S ADVENT COULD NOT FAIL TO MEAN A GREAT DEAL IN THE LIFE OF A GIRL LIKE ALICE
HE SHARPLY QUESTIONED FATHER BERET ONLY TO BE HALF CONVINCED THAT THE GOOD PRIEST TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID THAT HE KNEW NOTHING WHATEVER ON THE SUBJECT BEYOND THE FACT THAT THE BANNER HAD MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED FROM UNDER HIS FLOOR
THE CAPTAIN'S ADVENTURE WITH FATHER BERET CAME JUST IN TIME TO MAKE IT COUNT AGAINST THAT COURAGEOUS AND BELLICOSE MISSIONARY IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
THERE'S NO GOOD TO YOU AND NO HARM TO CLARK IN MISTREATING OR EVEN HOLDING THIS PRISONER
WHAT EFFECT HELM'S BOLD AND APPARENTLY ARTLESS TALK HAD UPON HAMILTON'S MIND IS NOT RECORDED
FATHER BERET'S MANNER AND VOICE WERE VERY MILD BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HINT OF STURDY DEFIANCE SOMEWHERE IN THEM
YOU DEVILISH HYPOCRITE IT WAS THEN THAT FATHER BERET TURNED DEADLY PALE AND SWIFTLY CROSSED HIMSELF
HE WAS ABOUT TO KILL FATHER BERET AND I SHOT HIM
THANK YOU FOR NOT INCLUDING ME AMONG THE LOYALISTS
ON HER WAY HOME ALICE MET FATHER BERET WHO TURNED AND WALKED BESIDE HER
DEAR CHILD SAID FATHER BERET STOPPING AT THE GATE AND LOOKING BESEECHINGLY INTO ALICE'S FACE YOU MUST STAY AT HOME NOW
HE LAUGHED AND LIFTED HER UP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD KISSING HER RESONANTLY
THERE WAS FURIOUS CURSING AMONG THE PATROLMEN AS THEY TUMBLED ABOUT IN THE ROOM THE UNHURT ONES TRAMPLING THEIR PROSTRATE COMPANIONS AND STRIKING WILDLY AT EACH OTHER IN THEIR BLINDNESS AND CONFUSION
AT THIS POINT A NEW PERFORMER CAME UPON THE STAGE A DARK ROBED THING SO ACTIVE THAT ITS OUTLINES CHANGED ELUSIVELY GIVING IT NO RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES
EVIDENTLY THEY DREADED TO TEST THE MARKSMANSHIP OF SUCH RIFLEMEN AS THEY KNEW MOST BORDER MEN TO BE
HE WAS SO DELIGHTED AT KENTON'S LUCK THAT HE BROKE FORTH GIGGLING AND THEREBY DREW AGAINST HIS OWN RIBS A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT OF LONG HAIR'S PEDAL APPLICATIONS
THE WIND AND RAIN STILL PREVAILED WHEN THEY WERE READY TO SET FORTH AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT EXTREMELY COLD A SEARCHING CHILL WENT WITH EVERY THROB THAT MARKED THE STORM'S WAVES
FARNSWORTH'S FACE WHITENED WITH ANGER
THIS GIRL IS GUILTY OF HARBORING A SPY AND RESISTING A LAWFUL ATTEMPT OF MY GUARDS TO CAPTURE HIM
STILL BEVERLEY'S SPIRITS ROSE WITH EVERY ROD OF DISTANCE THAT WAS ADDED TO THEIR SLOW PROGRESS
HERE LONG HAIR STOPPED AND WITHOUT A WORD CUT THE THONGS FROM BEVERLEY'S WRISTS
THE RESILIENCE OF A YOUTHFUL AND POWERFUL PHYSIQUE OFFERS MANY A PROBLEM TO THE BIOLOGIST
FATHER BERET'S PATERNAL LOVE FOR ALICE
THE MEMORY OF THAT INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIEST WAS IN FARNSWORTH'S MIND WHEN BOILING WITH RAGE HE LEFT HAMILTON'S PRESENCE AND WENT FORTH INTO THE CHILL FEBRUARY AIR
YOU DID NOT INTERRUPT ME FATHER BERET
HE DESCRIBED THE DREARY AND COMFORTLESS ROOM IN WHICH ALICE WAS CONFINED THE MISERABLE FARE GIVEN HER AND HOW SHE WOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE LEERS AND LOW REMARKS OF THE SOLDIERS
HAMILTON SAT FOR SOME TIME AFTER HELM'S DEPARTURE THINKING OVER WHAT HE NOW FEARED WAS A FOOLISH MISTAKE
AFTER SOME FUMBLING AND DELAY HE FITTED THE KEY WITH A STEADY HAND AND MOVED THE WOODEN BOLT CREAKING AND JOLTING FROM ITS SLOT
HE HALTED STILL SMILING VILLAINOUSLY
IT WAS FATHER BERET AND HOW GRIM HE LOOKED
THE BULLET FROM HIS WEAPON CUT THROUGH FATHER BERET'S CLOTHES BETWEEN HIS LEFT ARM AND HIS BODY SLIGHTLY CREASING THE FLESH ON A RIB
FATHER BERET UTTERED A SHORT THIN CRY AND MOVED AS IF TO GO TO THE FALLEN GIRL BUT JUST THEN HE SAW HAMILTON'S SWORD PASS OVER AGAIN INTO HIS RIGHT HAND AND KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT DEATH OR FIGHT
HAMILTON WAS IN THE HABIT OF CONSIDERING EVERY ANTAGONIST IMMEDIATELY CONQUERABLE
AS HE SPRANG TOWARD FATHER BERET THERE WAS A MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND WE SPEAK GUARDEDLY SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED EXACTLY LIKE AN EXCHANGE OF FURIOUS EXECRATIONS
WAS THIS INDEED FATHER BERET THAT GENTLE OLD MAN NOW BEFORE HIM OR WAS IT AN AVENGING DEMON FROM THE SHADES
IT WAS SINGULARLY LOOSE PLAY A SORT OF WAVERING SHIFTY INCOMPREHENSIBLE SHOW OF CARELESSNESS THAT CAUSED HAMILTON TO ENTERTAIN A DOUBT WHICH WAS REALLY A FEAR AS TO WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
THE BLADE LEAPED TOWARD FATHER BERET'S HEART WITH A TWINKLE LIKE LIGHTNING
IT WAS A DISCONCERTING THING FOR HIM BUT HE RALLIED INSTANTLY AND SPRANG ASIDE TAKING A NEW POSITION JUST IN TIME TO FACE FATHER BERET AGAIN
FATHER BERET WAS THINKING OF ALICE
AS HE DID THIS FATHER BERET SETTLED HIMSELF AS YOU HAVE SEEN A MIGHTY HORSE DO IN THE HOME STRETCH OF A RACE
FATHER BERET'S SWORD SEEMED TO BE REVOLVING
FATHER BERET CORRECTLY INTERPRETED WHAT HE SAW
EVERY WORD THAT FATHER BERET HAD SPOKEN WAS TRUE AND WENT HOME WITH FORCE
BUT THE WAN COLD FACE OF THE GIRL HAD MORE POWER THAN THE RAPIER'S HUNGRY POINT
FATHER BERET WAVED HIS HAND WITH IMPATIENCE
FATHER BERET PLUCKED UP THE RAPIER THAT HE HAD WRENCHED FROM HAMILTON'S HAND
FATHER BERET SCARCELY FELT THE WEIGHT OF ALICE'S BODY WHEN HE LIFTED IT FROM THE GROUND SO HEAVY WAS THE PRESSURE OF HIS GRIEF
FATHER BERET WAS ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE CROSS STILL AS A STATUE HIS CLASPED HANDS EXTENDED UPWARD
NOW HERE IS A SOUP NOT ESPECIALLY SATISFYING TO THE TASTE OF A GOURMET LIKE YOURSELF BUT POSSESSING THE SOOTHING QUALITY THAT IS GOOD FOR ONE JUST AROUSED FROM AN UNUSUAL NAP
FATHER BERET OPENED IT TO ONE OF HAMILTON'S AIDES
BESIDES HIS NERVES WERE UNRULY AS THEY HAD BEEN EVER SINCE THE ENCOUNTER WITH FATHER BERET
IT WAS A SHEENY CRINKLED WISP OF WARM LOOKING HAIR LOOPED ACROSS THE CHEEK IN WHICH HE HAD OFTEN SEEN A SAUCY DIMPLE DANCE WHEN ALICE SPOKE OR SMILED
THE CREOLES WERE LOYAL TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM
WHILE HE HASTILY SWIGGED AND SMACKED HE HEARD THE FIRING BEGIN WITH A CRACKLING DESULTORY VOLLEY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN ORDER FROM CLARK THEY NOW TOOK POSITION NEAR THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE STOCKADE AND BEGAN FIRING ALTHOUGH IN THE DARKNESS THERE WAS BUT LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR MARKSMANSHIP
I RECOGNIZED LIEUTENANT BARLOW'S HAIR AS SOON AS I SAW IT
HE COULD NOT FACE FATHER BERET WHO WOULD PROBABLY BE THERE
IN FACT BEVERLEY'S FACE WAS AS RIGID AS MARBLE
IN RESPONSE THE OLD MAN WITH GROTESQUE SOLEMNITY DREW HIS BUCKHORN HANDLED KNIFE LICKED ITS BLADE AND RETURNED IT TO ITS SHEATH
A BIT OF PANTOMIME WELL UNDERSTOOD AND KEENLY ENJOYED BY THE ONLOOKING CREOLES
FATHER BERET WAS INDEED PRESENT AT THE CHURCH AS HAMILTON HAD DREADED
HE ACCEPTED PROMPTLY APPENDING TO THE ARTICLES OF CAPITULATION THE FOLLOWING REASONS FOR HIS ACTION
BESIDE THE MAIN GATE OF THE STOCKADE TWO COMPANIES OF PATRIOTS UNDER BOWMAN AND MCCARTY WERE DRAWN UP AS GUARDS WHILE THE BRITISH GARRISON FILED OUT AND WAS TAKEN IN CHARGE
OUTSIDE THE FORT THE CREOLES WERE BEGINNING A NOISE OF JUBILATION
IT WAS A SOUND FAMILIAR TO ALL THE CREOLES
AND HE STRODE ALONG THE WALL OF THE STOCKADE TURNING THE CORNERS AND HEAVILY SHAMBLING OVER THE INEQUALITIES TILL HE REACHED THE POSTERN
THE CREOLES WERE HE KNEW JUSTLY EXASPERATED AND EVEN HIS OWN MEN HAD BEEN SHOWING A SPIRIT WHICH MIGHT EASILY BE FANNED INTO A DANGEROUS FLAME OF VENGEANCE
FATHER BERET WHO HAD JUST BEEN ADMITTED QUIETLY TOOK A PLACE AT ONE SIDE NEAR THE WALL
IN THE DISTANCE HE SAW FATHER BERET HURRYING TO THE SPOT WHERE SOME OF THE MEN BURNT AND WOUNDED BY THE EXPLOSION WERE BEING STRIPPED AND CARED FOR
DON'T CRY ADRIENNE
THEY ALWAYS COME BACK FATHER BERET CAME IN A LITTLE LATER
YES FATHER BERET YES I KNOW AND I AM ASHAMED
SHE PULLED FATHER BERET'S SLEEVE
JEAN HOWEVER LYING AWAKE IN HIS LITTLE BED OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION WHICH HE REPEATED TO ALICE NEXT MORNING WITH GREAT CIRCUMSTANTIALITY
TO HAVE MADE IT PUBLIC WOULD HAVE EXASPERATED THE CREOLES AND SET THEM VIOLENTLY AGAINST CLARK A THING HEAVY WITH DISASTER FOR ALL HIS FUTURE PLANS
MISS MCPHERSON
AND AS TO FALSE HAIR AND FRIZZES AND POWDER AND ALL THE MANY DEVICES USED AS SHE SAID TO BUILD A WOMAN SHE ABOMINATED THEM AND PREFERRED TO BE JUST WHAT THE LORD HAD MADE HER WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE UPON HIS WORK
NONE OF THE GUESTS HAD EVER SEEN MISS MCPHERSON SO EXCITED AND FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE WHILE THEY GAZED AT HER WONDERINGLY AS SHE SAT WITH LIPS COMPRESSED AND NOSTRILS DILATED LOOKING INTENTLY OVER THEIR HEADS AT SOMETHING THEY COULD NOT SEE BUT WHICH EVIDENTLY WAS VERY VIVID TO HER
BUT HE INSULTED ME FIRST GREY REPLIED AND MISS MCPHERSON INSISTED
THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO NEIL MCPHERSON AND I AM ASHAMED OF IT NOW FOR I CAME TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
OH HANNAH THE OLD MAN SAID WHIMPERINGLY
SO CONFIDENT WAS MISS MCPHERSON THAT HER NEPHEW WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE HIS DAUGHTER REMOVED FROM THE INFLUENCES AROUND HER TO A HOME WHERE SHE WAS SURE OF ENOUGH TO EAT AND THAT HIS FRIVOLOUS WIFE WOULD BE GLAD TO BE RID OF A CHILD WHO MUST BE IN THE WAY OF HER FLIRTATIONS THAT SHE WAS CONSTANTLY EXPECTING TO HEAR THAT SHE WAS COMING
NOT AT ALL POISONOUS OR MALARIOUS
I WOULDN'T ARCHIE SAID LOOKING REFLECTINGLY AT HER
IT WOULD NEVER DO FOR A MCPHERSON TO BE IN TRADE
FOR THESE HABITUAL PLAYERS AT MONTE CARLO ARE VERY SUPERSTITIOUS AND IT TAKES BUT LITTLE TO UNNERVE THEM
AND AMONG THESE YOUNG WOMEN DAISY MCPHERSON SAT THE MORNING AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT MONTE CARLO WITH A LOOK OF SWEET INNOCENCE ON HER FACE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF THE ATTENTION SHE WAS ATTRACTING
THEN AS TED'S IRISH BLOOD BEGAN TO TINGLE WITH EXCITEMENT MORE RECKLESSLY UNTIL HE WHISPERED TO HER
WHERE DO YOU LIVE MISS MCPHERSON DID NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS BUT SAID INSTEAD
I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS LADY JANE BEGAN STAMMERINGLY
FOR A MOMENT ARCHIE'S HEART LEAPED INTO HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT OF EMANCIPATING HIS CHILD FROM THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE AROUND HER BUT WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW DESOLATE HE SHOULD BE WITHOUT HER HE SAID
SHE IS THE PUREST AND SWEETEST AND BEST GIRL I EVER KNEW AND I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD HURT YOU OR BLANCHE EITHER TO PAY HER SOME ATTENTION AND HAVING SAID SO MUCH THE YOUNG MAN LEFT THE ROOM IN TIME TO ESCAPE BLANCHE'S TEARS AND HIS MOTHER'S ANGER AND REPROACHES
LORDS AND EARLS AND DUKES AND DEANS AND PRIME MINISTERS AND EVERYBODY
SHE KNEW THE WHOLE FOR SHE HAD SEEN A LETTER TO HER FATHER WRITTEN BY LADY JANE WHO STATED THE CASE IN PLAIN LANGUAGE AND DENOUNCING DAISY AS A DISGRACE TO THE MCPHERSON FAMILY ASKED THAT ARCHIE SHOULD EXERCISE HIS MARITAL AUTHORITY AND KEEP HIS WIFE AT HOME
I AM A BEAUTIFUL DARNER
SUCH THINGS WERE THRASHED INTO ME AT SCHOOL BUT HANGED IF I HAVE THEM AND THEIR HISTORY AT MY TONGUE'S END AS YOU HAVE
I WANT YOU TO GET YOURSELF UP STUNNINGLY HE SAID SO AS TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST APPEARANCE
ONLY I DO NOT WANT THIS AMERICAN FROM BOSTON WHERE THE WOMEN ARE SO FULL OF BRAINS TO THINK ME A MERE DISHWASHER AND CHIMNEY SWEEP
YOUR VERY AFFECTIONATE NEPHEW NEIL MCPHERSON
AND IN SHORT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO LOVE AND BE INTERESTED IN AS SOMETHING TOLD HER SHE COULD BE INTERESTED IN AND LOVE BESSIE MCPHERSON
I SHALL BE BETTER IN A FEW DAYS WHEN THE WEATHER MODERATES
IF I AM ANY JUDGE HE IS MORE THAN HALF IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WHEN I SAID I WAS GOING TO WRITE AND REGRETTED THAT I COULD NOT SEND YOU ANY MONEY AS I WAS SURE YOU MUST NEED IT AFTER SO MUCH COMPANY HE INSISTED UPON LOANING ME TWENTY POUNDS AND WHEN I REFUSED SO LARGE A SUM HE MADE ME TAKE TEN WHICH I WILL DIVIDE WITH YOU
THEN I HAVE INTRODUCED THEM TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE AMONG WHOM ARE SOME ENGLISH LORDS AND LADIES AND GERMAN BARONS AND BARONESSES
YES MISTER MCPHERSON REPLIED THE AMERICAN I REMEMBER
TO NEIL MCPHERSON
SOMEBODY THEY HAVE PICKED UP TO MAKE A SPLURGE WITH
LADY MCPHERSON MISS BETSEY REPEATED THERE IS NO LADY MCPHERSON EXCEPT MY BROTHER'S WIFE LADY JANE AND SHE IS ALMOST AS DRIED UP AND YELLOW BY THIS TIME AS I AM WHILE THIS LADY IS YOUNG AND
LADY MCPHERSON INDEED AND MISS BETSEY SPRANG TO HER FEET SO ENERGETICALLY AS TO STARTLE HER VISITOR WHO HAD NO IDEA WHAT SHE MEANT
NO DAISY SAID STAMMERINGLY
DON'T YOU LIKE ME A LITTLE NOW AND I SO LONELY AND SAD AND ALL THE MORE SO THAT I HAVE TO KEEP UP AND SMILE BEFORE THESE PEOPLE WHO KIND AS THEY ARE BORE ME WITH THEIR VULGARITIES
I OWE SO MUCH TO THESE KIND PEOPLE WHOSE VULGARITIES BORE YOU BUT DO NOT PREVENT YOU FROM ACCEPTING THEIR HOSPITALITY
NOTHING IN FACT HAD TOUCHED HIM UNTIL HE SAW BESSIE MCPHERSON WHOM HE HAD REMEMBERED ALWAYS AND SOMETIMES TO HIMSELF HE HAD SAID
JACK YOU LOVED BESSIE MCPHERSON YES JACK ANSWERED HIM UNHESITATINGLY
DOUBLING AND TREBLING SOMETIMES AND ALWAYS WINNING AS IT IS SAID SATAN WHO RULES THAT DEN LETS THE NOVICES DO
THEN GOING UP TO MISS MCPHERSON HE CONTINUED
BUT MISS MCPHERSON DID NOTHING
I GUESS I HAD BETTER DRINK SOME BONESET WHEN I GET HOME
HE DISLIKES ALLINGTON WORSE THAN I DO AND MOPES ALL DAY IN HIS ROOM JUST AS HIS FATHER DID
SHE SHRANK BEHIND HER FATHER DAZZLED AS IF BY A SUNBURST
SECOND OLD MAN PROVERBIALLY DUFFING AND BALLET
HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE DONE SUCH A THING UNDER A RESPONSIBLE LESSEE BUT IN A COMMONWEALTH MORALS BECOME RELAXED
MY MOTHER BURST INTO TEARS WHEN SHE HEARD MY SCHOOLFELLOW'S NAME AND ASKED ME TO BRING HIM TO SEE HER
AND SIR NUGENT AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS COMPLETED THE CIRCLE
YOU ARE BOUND TO MAKE A GREAT MARRIAGE IF NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE FOR VIOLA'S
MISS BELLINGHAM RECEIVED HIM WITH A BRIGHT LOOK OF WELCOME DESPITE THE DOWAGER'S WARNING AND THEIR HANDS MET WITH A GENTLE PRESSURE ON CHURCHILL'S PART
HE HAD ALMOST MADE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY THE ACTOR'S DAUGHTER
IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE WAY FROM THE THEATRE TO THE ACTOR'S LODGINGS SO JAMES PERSUADED HER TO WALK ROUND BY THE CATHEDRAL JUST TO SEE HOW IT LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT
THE CATHEDRAL HAD A COLOSSAL GRANDEUR SEEN FROM SO NEAR EVERY FINIAL AND WATERSPOUT CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE MOONLIGHT
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT VILLAINY LURKED BENEATH THE BOHEMIAN'S ROUGH KINDLINESS
ARMLESS CHAIRS OF THE SAME PERIOD WITH AN UNKNOWN CREST EMBLAZONED ON THEIR MAHOGANY BACKS
SIR NUGENT NEVER CAME UPSTAIRS IN THE MORNING
GREAT LAVENDER BUSHES FORESTS OF UNPRUNED ROSES TALL WHITE LILIES SYRINGA CARNATIONS WEEDS AND BLOSSOMS GROWING AS THEY WOULD
MARTIN COLOURED LIKE A SCHOOLBOY JUSTLY SUSPECTED OF FELONIOUS VIEWS IN RELATION TO APPLES
FLOWERS BIRDS STATUETTES PICTURES A GLIMPSE OF SUNLIT GARDEN ON ONE SIDE AND AN OPEN PIANO ON THE OTHER
HE FELT INSIDE THE VAGABOND'S LOOSE SHIRT THINKING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN HIS BOOTY IN HIS BOSOM BUT WITH NO RESULT
EXCEPT THE SAME DONOR'S OFFERINGS OF BOOKS AND MUSIC
THE GIRL HANDED HER SALARY OVER TO THE PATERNAL EXCHEQUER WITHOUT A QUESTION AND WAS GRATEFUL FOR AN OCCASIONAL POUND OR TWO TOWARDS THE REPLENISHMENT OF HER SCANTY WARDROBE
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH HER SUPERIORS OR TO BE THOUGHT ANYTHING BETTER THAN A YEOMAN'S WIFE BUT HER STRONG POINT HAS BEEN THE FAMILY CREDIT
ALTOGETHER MISS BARLOW'S SCHOOL STOOD VERY HIGH IN PEOPLE'S ESTIMATION AND I FELT FLATTERED BY MISS BARLOW'S ASKING MY DAUGHTER TO VISIT HER NOW THAT MURIEL'S SCHOOLING DAYS WERE OVER AND THERE WAS NO MORE MONEY TO BE EXPECTED FROM US
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT MISS BARLOW'S INVITATION
MAURICE TOOK THE CANDLE FROM MISS BELLINGHAM'S HAND AND HELD IT UP BEFORE THE PICTURE OVER THE MANTELPIECE
HE WAS ONE WHO HUNG ON TO OUR THEATRE ROYAL TO THE VERY LAST STUCK TO IT LIKE A BARNACLE POOR FELLOW WHEN THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SUSTENANCE TO BE GOT OUT OF IT TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER
FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS OR UPWARDS I MADE IT A RULE TO KEEP A COPY OF EVERY PLAYBILL ISSUED IN OUR TOWN
THE DUMB WAITER WITH ITS RESERVE OF GLASSES AND CRUETS GUARANTEED THAT LUXURIOUS EASE WHICH IS NOT DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL SERVICE
EVEN HIS NICE JUDGMENT HAD FAILED TO DIVINE WHETHER THE JOINT WERE BEEF OR MUTTON BUT HE OPINED MUTTON
I MUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW TO LOOK FOR MISS BARLOW'S ADDRESS
BARLOWS WHO DEALT IN UPHOLSTERY
SO MANY SPURIOUS MISS BARLOWS EAGER TO HEAR OF SOMETHING TO THEIR ADVANTAGE WOULD BE CONJURED INTO BEING BY ANY APPEAL PUBLISHED IN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THE TIMES
SHE MAY HAVE ITALIANIZED THE SPELLING OF HER NAME TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO HER PATRONS
I COULD ONLY SEE MURIEL IN THE PRESENCE OF HER MOTHER AND FATHER WHO RECEIVED ME WITH OLD FASHIONED CEREMONIOUSNESS AND GAVE ME NO OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ALONE WITH MY PUPIL
WHETHER THE OLD SQUIRE DID OR DID NOT FOREGO HIS THREAT OF AN UNJUST WILL IT WOULD BE NO BAD THING FOR MURIEL TO BE A CAPTAIN'S OR A MAJOR'S WIFE I THOUGHT EVEN IF HER HUSBAND WERE LANDLESS OR FORTUNELESS
HE LAY AWAKE FOR THREE HOURS ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT AND HEARD NOT A SOUND SAVE THE OCCASIONAL SCUFFLINGS PATTERINGS AND SQUEALINGS OF MICE BEHIND THE WAINSCOT
IT SCORCHES ME TO THE HEART
BUT I KNOW THAT IN HIS HEART HE LOVES ME BEST OF ALL HIS SONS AND THAT IT WOULD LACERATE THAT HEART TO DISINHERIT ME
THE THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS ALTOGETHER ABSORBED HIS MIND AND HE SCARCELY REALIZED THE FACT OF HIS GRANDCHILD'S CLAIM TO WEALTH AND POSITION
IT WAS LIGHTED FROM THE TOP BY A LARGE GROUND GLASS DOME AND WAS LINED FROM FLOOR TO CEILING WITH BOOKCASES OF EBONIZED WOOD RELIEVED WITH NARROW LINES OF GOLD
AND AGAIN YOU ARE TO REMEMBER THAT THE SAME AUTHORITY YOU HAVE JUST QUOTED TELLS YOU THAT NO MARRIAGE IS VOIDABLE AFTER THE DEATH OF EITHER OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES
I WILL GET COUNSEL'S OPINION WITHOUT DELAY IF YOU DESIRE IT AND I SUPPOSE IN A CASE SO NEARLY AFFECTING YOUR INTERESTS YOU WOULD PREFER AN UNPREJUDICED OPINION TO BEING YOUR OWN ADVISER
A SOLITARY UNDERLING WAS LOLLING ACROSS THE HALF DOOR OF THE HARNESS ROOM SMOKING THE PIPE OF DISCONTENT
SIR NUGENT BELLINGHAM COMES TO CORNWALL ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR A WEEK OR SO YAWNS TREMENDOUSLY ALL THE TIME LOOKS AT ACCOUNTS WHICH HE DOESN'T IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND AND GOES BACK TO HIS CLUBS AND THE STONY HEARTED STREETS WITH INFINITE RELIEF
AND IT WON'T BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE HER SEE THIS TIME THAT I AM ASKING MORE FOR CREDIT'S SAKE THAN FOR PLEASURE
AND WHERE DO YOU PLAY IN GRANDPAPA'S GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE
AND I KNOW A BLACKBIRD AND EVER SO MANY ROBIN REDBREASTS AND THEY KNOW ME AND I DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ AGNES A LITTLE
I CAN'T HELP THINKING BETSY THAT I SEE HIM EVERY NOW AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF MY BED WITH HIS OLD HAT AND HIS SPUD AND HIS BROWN GAITERS
AND ON THE IMPORTANT CHAPTER OF HER IMPROVEMENTS THE GENUINE MODESTY OF THE LITTLE GIRL DID HER GREAT DISSERVICE
A CLOTHIER'S WIFE TO BE SURE WAS NOT EXACTLY THE SORT OF PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN HAD CHOICE BEEN LEFT HER
BARNABY SAW ENOUGH TO OFFER A MOST SATISFACTORY SELECTION AND HEARTILY TO WEARY AGNES WHO FOLLOWED HER UP AND DOWN INNUMERABLE STAIRS AND STOOD BEHIND HER DURING WHAT SEEMED ENDLESS COLLOQUIES WITH A MULTITUDE OF RESPECTABLE LOOKING LANDLADIES LONG AFTER SHE HAD FLATTERED HERSELF THAT HER AUNT MUST HAVE BEEN SUITED TO HER HEART'S DESIRE BY WHAT SHE HAD ALREADY SEEN
BARNABY WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE FORTUNATE THAN SHE HAD VENTURED TO HOPE FOR THE CLOTHIER AND THE CLOTHIER'S FAMILY HELD A MUCH HIGHER STATION IN SOCIETY THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
PETERS PLEADED GUILTY TO DISLIKING HER AFFECTIONATE SISTER QUITE AS MUCH ON TUESDAY MORNING AS SHE HAD DONE ON MONDAY NIGHT
ARE WE TO HAVE A GOOD BALL ON TUESDAY IF ALL THE WORLD CAN BE MADE TO KNOW THAT MISS MADDOX WILL BE THERE ALL THE WORLD WILL ASSUREDLY BE THERE TO MEET HER REPLIED THE GENTLEMAN
AND ON WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE FLASHINGS OF HER LUSTROUS EYES
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE WISHING YOURSELF JOY ON THE SUCCESS OF YOUR PLOTTINGS AND PLANNINGS
BUT SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY COMPELLED TO RESEAT HERSELF BY THE UNIVERSAL HUSH
AND FOR THIS IT WAS THAT HE WAS THUS INSULTINGLY DESIRED TO DEPART
IN ALL HER MEDITATIONS IN ALL HER PLOTTINGS IN ALL HER REASONINGS SHE SAW NOTHING BEFORE HER BUT SUCCESS
THE WIDOW TO GIVE ORDERS AS SHE PASSED TO HER DRAWING ROOM THAT IF MISTER ALEXANDER PRINGLE CALLED ON HER HE SHOULD BE ADMITTED
BUT IT IS PROBABLE MISTER ALEXANDER PRINGLE EXPECTED RATHER TO FIND A PATIENT THAN TO BE USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF A LADY IN A STATE OF HEALTH APPARENTLY SO PERFECT
MISTER PRINGLE BOWED
GENTLEMEN OF YOUR PROFESSION MISTER PRINGLE HAVE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD THAT IT IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR A STRANGER ON FIRST ARRIVING AT A NEW PLACE TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONVERSING WITH THEM
MISTER ALEXANDER PRINGLE WAS DECIDEDLY A CLEVER MAN AND CLEVER MEN OF HIS PROFESSION ARE GENERALLY SKILFUL IN DISCERNING DIAGNOSTICS OF VARIOUS KINDS
MISTER PRINGLE WHO WAS VERY NEAR LAUGHING HIMSELF ANSWERED WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
I NEVER SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING ABROAD WITHOUT TREASURING IT IN MY MEMORY FOR YOUR LADYSHIP'S SERVICE
YOU ARE A VERY FINE FELLOW PRINGLE AND HAVE HIT THIS OFF WELL
I OFFER MYSELF MY DRAWING ROOM SHALL BE OPEN TO HER PRINGLE
INTRODUCE ME GRIFFITHS WHISPERED HIS COMPANION
LADY ELIZABETH NORRIS'S PARTY WAS FIVE DAYS AFTER THE BALL
LADY STEPHENSON'S INSTRUMENT IS A VERY FINE ONE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOBLE VISIONS WITH WHICH SHE HAD RECREATED HER FANCY DURING THE LAST MONTH SHE NOW WITH GREAT GOOD SENSE SENT THEM ALL TO THE MOON KNOWING SHE COULD EASILY CALL THEM BACK AGAIN IF ALL WENT WELL WITH HER
THE WAITER'S ACCOUNT WAS STRICTLY TRUE FOR HIS LORDSHIP WAS AT BREAKFAST AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS PACKING
AND I WAS TOLD AT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING THAT SIMMONS WHO FURNISHED THE CARRIAGE HORSES AND SERVANTS IS GONE TO LONDON TO LOOK AFTER HER
AND FORGETTING ALL THE BEEF STEAKS CHEESECAKES PORTER AND BLACK WINE THAT HE HAD SWALLOWED AT THE WIDOW'S COST HE VERY CAVALIERLY SENT WORD BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICER WHO HAD BROUGHT HER NOTE THAT HE WAS VERY SORRY BUT THAT IT WAS TOTALLY OUT OF HIS POWER TO COME
ANOTHER EFFORT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM MIGHT HAVE FOUND WAY HAD NOT THE GENTLEMAN RECOVERED HIS VOICE FIRST AND RESUMED THE CONVERSATION IN A TONE SO CHILLINGLY RESERVED THAT THE TIMID BROKEN SPIRITED GIRL HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO PRICK THE SIDES OF HER INTENT AND LAY HER INNOCENT HEART OPEN BEFORE HIM
AND DO AGNES BUY AS YOU COME ALONG HALF A DOZEN CHEESECAKES AND HALF A DOZEN QUEEN CAKES AND A SMALL JAR FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE SHILLINGS OF BRANDY CHERRIES
SELF REPROACH WAS LOST IN THE SORT OF ECSTASY WITH WHICH SHE REMEMBERED HOW THRIFTILY SHE HAD HOARDED HER WEALTH AND HOW AMPLE WERE THE MEANS SHE POSSESSED TO GIVE PROTECTION AND WELCOME TO THE POOR ORPHAN WHO THUS SOUGHT A REFUGE IN HER BOSOM
AND AS I HAVE SCARCELY EVER TOUCHED THE RENTS A LITTLE STUDY OF THE THEORY OF INTEREST AND COMPOUND INTEREST WILL PREVENT YOUR BEING SURPRISED WHEN I TELL YOU THAT MY PRESENT INCOME IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED PER ANNUM CLEAR OF ALL OUTGOINGS WHATEVER
FROM BEING A REPROBATED OUTCAST BANISHED FROM THE ROOF THAT SHELTERED HER SHE HAD BECOME THE SOLE OBJECT OF LOVE AND CARE TO ONE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE IT IN HER POWER TO MAKE LIFE A PARADISE TO HER
THE LETTER ITSELF MODEST AND UNBOASTFUL AS IT WAS GAVE A SUFFICIENTLY IMPROVED PICTURE OF HER CONDITION TO REMOVE ALL PRESENT ANXIETY ON HER ACCOUNT
NO NOT EVEN WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU LOOKED DOWN UPON AVON'S DUN STREAM
I TOLD HIM MISS WILLOUGHBY THAT A YOUNG LADY CHAPERONED BY A PERSON WITH THE MANNERS AND APPEARANCE OF YOUR AUNT BARNABY WAS NOT A FITTING WIFE FOR HIM
NEAT AND FIRM AS HE WAS WOMEN DID NOT CARE FOR HIM IN THE LEAST AND HE RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT BY HEARTILY DISLIKING THE FEMALE SEX
FAR FROM DISLIKING THEM HE SOUGHT THEM ON ALL POSSIBLE OCCASIONS OFTENTIMES TO HIS OWN DISADVANTAGE
GOOD LORD HOW THEY DO TALK AND ALL ABOUT THEIR OWN FEELINGS THEIR OWN WOES THEIR OWN TROUBLES THEIR OWN INFERNAL EGOTISMS
SHE HAS SUCCEEDED SO FAR BUT I HAVE MANAGED TO CHECKMATE HER BY OBTAINING THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH YOU
EACH HAD PASSED A WAKEFUL NIGHT EACH HAD BEEN FASCINATED BY THE ACCOUNT OF A CRIME THE ONE REAL THE OTHER FICTIONAL
THE NAMES AND PLACES ARE NO DOUBT FICTIONAL BUT THE WHOLE STORY IS NARRATED PLAINLY ENOUGH
HE COULD ONLY WAIT FOR THE FIAT OF THE HIGHER POWER
THAT CLAUDE'S PERUSAL OF THOSE PAPERS WOULD RESULT IN YOUR ACCOMPANYING HIM TO THIS OFFICE I FELT SURE
WITH INCREASING AGE A DISTASTE HAD COME FOR VIOLENT EXCITEMENTS AND WITH ONE OF CLAUDE'S TEMPERAMENT HE KNEW THAT THE CHANCES WERE THAT THE ENSUING QUARTER OF AN HOUR WOULD BE SOMEWHAT STIRRING
THE INSCRUTABILITY OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE BAFFLED HIM AND HE TURNED OFF THE REMARK WITH A DRY LAUGH
LONG YEARS OF TRAINING CONSTANT NECESSITY HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS TO TURN HIS FACE INTO A MASK OF INSCRUTABILITY
HAVE I NOT IMPLORED THREATENED BESEECHED COMMANDED
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY EACH TRYING TO OUTSTARE THE OTHER
NOVELISTS ESSAYISTS PAINTERS POETS AND MUSICIANS WERE ALL TO BE FOUND IN HER ROOMS AND A MORE MOTLEY COLLECTION COULD BE SEEN NOWHERE ELSE IN LONDON
ARE YOU HERE AS THOUGH THE PLACE WERE HEAVEN AND THE SPEAKER JUSTIFIABLY SURPRISED THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE SAVED EXCEPT HIMSELF OR HERSELF
STILL AS SHE WAS CLAUDE'S MOTHER HE HAD TOO MUCH GOOD BREEDING AND TOO MUCH LIKING FOR HIS FRIEND TO STATE HIS BELIEF
THIS WAS UNDIPLOMATIC BUT AT TIMES HUMAN NATURE IS TOO STRONG FOR TRAINING
HE WAS ALWAYS A SOFTY FROM A BOY NOT THAT HE'S OLD NOW SIR
I PROMISED TO REPORT MY DOINGS AND HEARINGS FAITHFULLY TO YOU AND I HEREBY KEEP MY PROMISE AND AT THE COST OF YOUR LOSING YOUR TEMPER
I WAS TRYING TO MAINTAIN A RACER'S SPEED
IN PRINTER'S JARGON I WOULD SOON BE IN PI
A NEWSMONGER ONE OF THE WORLD'S GOSSIPS
AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IDLY QUERYING WHETHER NATURE DID NOT SO BLEND ALL OUT OF DOOR SOUNDS AS TO MAKE THEM AGREEABLE
THIS MORNING PROVES THAT I AM NOT AN INGRAINED NEWSMONGER
I SOON FELT THAT IT WAS NOT THE THING TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS IRREVERENTLY LOOKING AROUND
THERE SAT A YOUNG QUAKERESS WHOSE SIDE FACE ARRESTED MY ATTENTION AND HELD IT
MY SWEET BRIAR BLOSSOMS WERE NOT MORE DELICATE IN THEIR PINK SHADINGS THAN WAS THE BLOOM ON HER ROUNDED CHEEK
AND HER THOUGHTS WILL FLOW WITH THE CLEARNESS AND UNPREMEDITATION OF THE BROOK THAT I CROSSED ON MY WAY HERE
WILL BE THE INDEX OF AN UNFAILING SPRING OF MIRTHFULNESS
UNPERVERTED WOMANLY NATURE YOU WILL FIND THE BEAUTY THAT WILL OUTLAST THAT OF FORM AND FEATURE
THE MIRTHFULNESS I HAD NOTED BEFORE GLIMMERED IN HER EYES FOR A MOMENT
CHILDREN RUMPLE AND SPOIL MY DRESS AND SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HERSELF APPROVINGLY
THERE IS ORIENTAL SIMPLICITY AND LARGENESS IN HER PARENTS' FAITH
MY HAND FAIRLY TINGLES YET FROM MY TOUCH OF DAPPLE'S NECK
EMILY WARREN THEE'S A GOOD YANKEE
WHERE ON ONE SIDE WERE MOWS FOR HAY AND GRAIN
PERSONALS ARE GENERALLY READ
A THUNDERSTORM PROSTRATES ME BUT AS IT PASSES I AM MYSELF AGAIN
FOR HE RESPIRED SLOWLY AND LABORIOUSLY
I LITTLE DREAMED THAT ON SUNDAY NIGHT I SHOULD BE MAKING COFFEE IN A GOOD OLD QUAKER'S KITCHEN
UNSANCTIONED BY THE BEST AND PUREST INSTINCTS OF HER WOMANLY NATURE
THERE I CRIED KISSING HER TWICE NOW I'M OVERPAID
AND THAT MUST DO TILL THEE'S MUCH STRONGER
OH I'M SO GLAD THEE'S GETTING WELL SHE CRIED
AND I SOON RECOGNIZED RARE AND PERFECT BUDS THAT AT THIS LATE SEASON ONLY A FLORIST COULD SUPPLY
IF THEE'S DOING THY BEST I'VE NOT A WORD TO SAY
WHICH HE FEARS MAY NOT OUTRIDE A STORM
AND IN THE EFFORT TO OXYGENIZE MY THIN PALE BLOOD
ENTERED THE ROCKAWAY
HE SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO PITY ME WHILE HE UNCTUOUSLY RUBS HIS HANDS IN SELF FELICITATION
RUBBING HIS HANDS IN A WAY THAT SUGGESTED A HABIT OF COMPLACENCY AND SELF FELICITATION
HE WAS HARBORING
AND I SAW THE OLD GLEAM OF MIRTHFULNESS IN MISS WARREN'S EYES
ARE YOU NOT OVERTAXING YOURSELF SHE ASKED GENTLY
BUT A BRIEF TIME SINCE I WOULD HAVE BERATED ANY FRIEND OF MINE WHO WOULD NOT TAKE THE SENSIBLE COURSE WHICH WOULD MAKE ALL HAPPY
IT WAS A REVELATION TO ME OF THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR AND WRETCHEDNESS INTO WHICH ONE CAN SINK WHEN UNSUSTAINED BY MANLY FORTITUDE OR CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE
AND BY FREQUENT ROMPS WITH THE CHILDREN
AND YET MY LOVE HAVE NO COUNTERACTION
BEFORE VERY LONG THE GREAT FAMILY ROCKAWAY UNLOADED ITS PRECIOUS FREIGHT AT THE HORSE BLOCK
THAT THE GOD OF THE BIBLE IS A DREAM OF OLD TIME MYSTICS
SPIRITUAL PRESENCE THAT UPLIFTS AND SUSTAINS THE SINKING HEART WHEN THE WHOLE GREAT WORLD COULD ONLY STAND HELPLESSLY BY
IT DOESN'T MATTER I SAID I'M EQUALLY FAMILIAR WITH CHOCTAW
BUT THEE'S BEEN A SENSIBLE MAN SINCE THEE GOT UP
AND I HASTENED TO ASSIST HER FROM THE ROCKAWAY
STOP THE ROCKAWAY HERE
REUBEN SPRANG OUT OF THE ROCKAWAY AND LAY DOWN AND ROLLED IN HIS UNCONTROLLABLE MIRTH
HE FOLLOWED HER RIGHT UP TO THE ROCKAWAY STEPS
IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE IN THE FAMILY ROCKAWAY
ALL THE COOKBOOKS IN THE WORLD COULDN'T ACCOUNT FOR IT
THERE WAS THE BOY THAT MOWED THE MACDONALD LAWN
AND WITH THE OTHER GIRLS WELCOMED AND ADMIRED THEIR UNIFORMS WHEN THEY CAME HOME ON SHORT FURLOUGHS
SOMEHOW IT STRUCK HER THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED SO FORLORN IF THEY HAD WORN NEW TRIG UNIFORMS
AND IT WAS BUT NATURAL WHEN EVERYBODY WAS SWEETHEARTING AND GETTING MARRIED
SO LIKE HER SON IN HER AMPLE BLANDNESS
THEY WERE HAVING A MARY PICKFORD MOVING PICTURE SHOW THERE
AND DOING IT JUST AS QUIETLY AND INCONSEQUENTIALLY AS YOU DID IT BEFORE
AND WAINWRIGHT'S BROW WAS DARK WITH INTENTION AS HE TURNED SHARPLY UP THE WALK TO THE BARRACKS WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD JUST LEFT
HE COULD NOT GET IT BACK OR UNWRITE IT MUCH AS HE WISHED IT
HE SAT STARING INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE THE MAN IN THE NEXT BUNK ROUSED TO TOSS BACK HIS BLANKET WHICH HAD FALLEN SUPERFLUOUSLY ACROSS HIS FACE
OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT FOR HIM NOT WITH THAT POSSESSIVENESS
HAD SHE SHRUNKEN SINCE HE LEFT HER OR WAS HE GROWN SO MUCH HUSKIER WITH THE OUT OF DOOR LIFE
HE HAD NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CHURCH GOER
WAINWRIGHT'S FACE DARKENED WITH AN UGLY FROWN
AND SHE HEARD HARRY WAINWRIGHT'S VOICE IN AN ANGRY SNARL
IT WAS WAINWRIGHT'S BLATANT VOICE AGAIN THAT BROKE THROUGH THE SABBATH AFTERNOON STILLNESS OF THE HOUSE AS SHE APPROACHED THE LIBRARY DOOR
BUT CAMERON'LL FIND A WAY OUT
IF YOU DO WHAT I TOLD YOU TO THAT CARBURETOR YOU'LL FIND IT WILL GO ALL RIGHT
HE CONVERSES ALMOST WHOLLY IN CHOICE PROFANITY
SHOOTING CRAP BECAME A PASSION
OFF AT HIS LEFT A NEW CRAP GAME WAS JUST STARTING
ANOTHER CRAP GAME HAD STARTED UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THEM
THE AIR WAS HAZIER THAN EVER
HE THOUGHT INSTANTLY OF WAINWRIGHT'S DISTASTEFUL FACE AND FORM
IN CONTEMPLATING THIS ACT OF ALLYING HIMSELF WITH GOD HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS BEING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND GOD
RUTH MACDONALD HAD THOUGHT OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY HERSELF
BUT SOMEHOW SHE WOULD HARDLY HAVE ASSOCIATED THE SALVATION ARMY WITH THE MACDONALD FAMILY IN ANY WAY
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT THE UNPRETENTIOUS LITTLE ONE STORY BUILDING THAT STRETCHED AWAY CAPACIOUSLY AND UNOSTENTATIOUSLY FROM THE GRASSY ROADSIDE
AND TEARY EYES
THE SALVATIONISTS SHOOK HANDS EARNESTLY WITH HIM
BOTH CAUGHT BY THE SALVATIONIST
SHE WAS NOT GIVING ATTENTION TO DETAILS LIKE CLOTHES AND HANDBAGS
AS SOME POOR WRETCH NEAR HIM WOULD WRITHE AND GROAN IN AGONY HIS RAGE WOULD BOIL UP ANEW
HE WAS TOUGHENED FOR SUCH EXPERIENCES SO WERE THE MEN ABOUT HIM
AT LAST THEY DETRAINED AND MARCHED INTO A LITTLE TOWN
FOR TWO DAYS THEY HIKED
REMINDING HIM OF WAINWRIGHT'S FAT KNEE
YOU'VE HIKED A LONG WAY
EVEN THUS HE DARED NOT SPEAK HIS HEART FOR THE IRON OF WAINWRIGHT'S POISON HAD ENTERED INTO HIS SOUL
AMID ALL THE SHUDDERINGS OF THE BATTLE RENT EARTH
THE WHISTLE OF A SHELL WENT RICOCHETING THROUGH THE AIR AND CAMERON DROPPED AS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO DO
SHELL HOLES AND STONES AND MIRING MUD
ITS DIM PRESENCE SEEMED TO GROW ON THE MISSIONARY'S THOUGHT AS HE DREW NEARER
UNTIL IT CAME BACK TO HER IN A VOLUME OF SEPULCHRAL SOUND THAT FILLED HER WITH A NAMELESS DREAD AND MADE HER FEAR TO OPEN HER LIPS AGAIN
A BIT OF THIN TRANSPARENTNESS
A MISSIONARY'S LIFE IS PRETTY LONESOME SOMETIMES YOU KNOW
HE BEGAN QUICKLY TO UNSTRAP THE CANVAS FROM BEHIND THE SADDLE
UNDER A BIT OF CANVAS WITH A STRANGE MISSIONARY'S ARM ABOUT HER
BUT EVEN HERE SHE FOUND EVIDENCES OF HER WISE GUIDE'S CARE
UNTIL HE HAD MADE EXCUSE AND LEFT THE PARTY AT PASADENA
WHITE FENCED WITH PICKETS LIKE CLEAN SUGAR FROSTING
SHE FELT THAT IN THE SIGHT MIGHT LIE HER EMANCIPATION FROM THE BEWITCHMENT THAT HAD BOUND HER IN ITS TOILS SINCE HER WESTERN TRIP
A SMALL SNAPSHOT OF THE CANYON
FOR THE SPEAKER HAD WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO THE MODERATOR AND WAS HURRYING FROM THE PLATFORM
THE CLAMOUR CEASED A MOMENT AS THE MODERATOR RAISED HIS HAND
THE HEAD NURSE AND THE HOUSE DOCTOR DECIDED RADCLIFFE NEEDED A CHANGE AND SUGGESTED A FEW DAYS AT THE SHORE WITH A CONVALESCING PATIENT
FAINTY SPELLS OFTENER
WITH HER EYES BLINDED WITH TEARS AND HER HEART SWELLING WITH THE LOSS OF THE WOMAN UPON WHOSE MOTHERLINESS SHE HAD COME TO FEEL A CLAIM
THE MISSIONARY HAD BEEN FOUND IN A DISTANT INDIAN HOGAN WITH A DISLOCATED ANKLE
SHE HAD LAID IT AWAY HERSELF IN THE BOX WITH THE BLUE SHOES AND THE CROCHETED CAP
FOR HER HEART WAS BURLEY'S
IT WAS A VERY TEARY AMELIA ELLEN WHO CLIMBED INTO THE TRAIN A FEW HOURS LATER
THE SPRAIN WAS A TROUBLESOME ONE AND PAINFUL
ADDING TO THE WIDE DESOLATENESS OF THE SCENE
THE ROSINESS OF SLEEP UPON HER CHEEKS AND THE DEWINESS OF IT UPON HER EYELIDS
AND WHEN SHE SPOKE OF HER HOSPITAL WORK HE TOUCHED HIS LIPS TO EYES AND BROW IN REVERENT WORSHIPFULNESS
AND HE HAS A HELPMEET FOR MY BOY SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD
KNEELING BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND DISHING UP THE STEAMING SOUP INTO THE HOT DISHES
ROBERTA
BUT I DO NOT THINK HE WAS HELD IN THE ESTEEM WHICH HE DESERVED BY ANOTHER OF HIS AMERICAN BROTHERS BY THE NAME OF PETER SCUDDER
AND WHAT MISTER SCUDDER SAID OF HIM WAS OF THE SAME UNKINDNESS
IT WAS OF MY DEAR FRIEND MISTER PETER SCUDDER
I THINK THAT MISTER PETER SCUDDER IS A VERY GREAT GENTLEMAN AND I SAT VERY STILL AND WHITE
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU THROUGH THE CUSTOMS THEN CAME THE NICE VOICE OF THAT MISTER PETER SCUDDER OF PHILADELPHIA FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF ME
THAT NO COCKTAIL EVER SHAKEN COULD GET OUT OF MY MIND MADE ANSWER THE VERY GRAVE MISTER PETER SCUDDER OF PHILADELPHIA
WHOM HE AND PETER SCUDDER HAD MET ON THE BOAT OVER
YOU ARE OFF ON A WEDDING TANGO AND THAT MAKES YOU COLD TO ALL WILES
WHICH HE HAD GIVEN UP FOR LOVE OF MY MOTHER AND FROM THE CRUELNESS OF MY WICKED UNCLE WHO WOULD NOT WELCOME HER TO HIS HOME
WHICH GAVE TO MY SPEAKING A GREAT HUSKINESS
BUT THE POWER IN THE BROADNESS OF HIS SHOULDERS AND IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS NERVOUS HANDS WAS OF A GREATNESS OF WHICH TO BE FRIGHTENED
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO HEAR ROBERTA
I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT IS THAT I CAN PUT INTO WORDS THE BEAUTIFUL FEELING THAT ROSE FROM THE INWARDNESS OF ME AS I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HOME OF MY FATHERS IN THIS FAR AWAY AMERICA
AND CONVERSE WITH HIM ABOUT MATTERS OF GOOD SENSE WITHOUT HAVING IN ANY WAY TO USE THAT COQUETRY WHICH BREAKS INTO SMALL SECTIONS THE USUAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN OF ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGNESS
NOT WAS THE VERY UNAPPRECIATIVE ANSWER THAT WAS MADE TO HER BY THAT BUZZ
BUT I BETHOUGHT ME TO REMOVE THAT SHIRT AND ALSO THE SILK ONE UNDERNEATH AND SWATH ABOUT ME ONE OF THE HEAVY TOWELS OF THE BATH
THAN I COULD HAVE HAD IF I HAD COME INTO HIS AND HER WORLD AS THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ROBERTA
AND HERE SAT GREAT STRONG ROBERTA
AND FOR THE REASON THAT I WAS VERY SLIGHTLY FATIGUED AND ALSO SLIGHTLY WARM FROM BEING OBLIGED TO DANCE IN THE VERY HEAVY SWATHINGS OF A GENTLEMAN
I'LL HAVE TO GET HEROICS BEFORE INSTRUCTIONS
THAT IS IF YOU KNOW WHAT ALL THESE KILO THINGS STAND FOR IN ENGLISH
AND THEIR LOVE FOR COMBAT WILL LEAD TO MATRIMONY IN THEIR EARLY YOUTH IF THEY ARE NOT RECONCILED TO EACH OTHER SOON SAID LOVELY SUE AS SHE FITTED HERSELF INTO MY ARMS FOR OUR TANGO
AND MY BUZZ'S EYES TWINKLED WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS OF A GREAT PLEASURE TO HIM I COULD OBSERVE
ARE YOU SURE YOU DISCOVERED NO FLAW OVER WHICH THE OLD GENERAL OR THE BIG STUPID GOVERNOR CAN HAGGLE I DISCOVERED NOT A FLAW I ANSWERED HER WITH A GREAT POSITIVENESS
BUT THAT POOR HUMAN BEING OF THE PRISON WAS NOT OF ENOUGH QUICKNESS TO DO THE KILLING OF HIS DESIRE IN THE FACE OF ROBERTA
BUT WHICH I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A LONGING FOR ROBERTA
CROSS EXAMINING FAILED TO GET THE STATEMENT FROM THE WOMAN THAT WOULD JUSTIFY MY REPRIEVING OR PARDONING HIM
ROBERTA I SAID TO MYSELF
THAT PLACE IS LOCATED IN THE HEART OF ROBERTA
AND AFTER MANY TELLINGS OF MY DESIRE
THE WOMAN ROBERTA
THESE HANDSHAKES OF AMERICA ARE VERY CONFUSING TO THOSE OF EUROPE
WHICH MADE THE HEART OF THAT ANGUISHED ROBERTA
WAS BORN THE HONEST WOMAN ROBERTA WHO MUST EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM A SITUATION NOT TO BE LONGER ENDURED
ARE POOR HANDLERS OF ANY LANGUAGE NOT OUR OWN
ENGAGED DEEPLY IN A MASS OF PAPERS ON THE TABLE BETWEEN THEM AND WITH NO THANKS TO ROBERTA
I SOUGHT OUT THAT MONSIEUR PETER SCUDDER TO INQUIRE FOR YOU
LIEUTENANT RICHARD CHADWICK'S DIVISION WAS COMING HOME
THE BARS ON HIS UNIFORM GLEAMING LIKE THE LIGHT IN MARY AMBER'S HAZEL EYES
AND THAT WAS A GOOD REASON WHY SHE MUST INVITE HIM AT ONCE TO VISIT HER INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL HE HAD BEEN TO HIS HOME AND BEEN DEMOBILIZED
FROM THIS PART OF HER PROMISE MARY AMBER'S SOUL RECOILED
APPETIZINGLY
MARY AMBER HAD SLIPPED OVER TO HER OWN HOUSE WHEN SHE FINISHED MASHING THE POTATOES
JUST PASSINGLY HE HAD A WISH THAT HE HAD A LIVING MOTHER TO WHOM HE COULD GO WITH HIS SICK HEART FOR HEALING
AND ALMOST SOFTENED THE HARD LOOK OF DISTRUST THAT HAD BEEN GROWING AROUND MARY AMBER'S GENTLE LIPS
TO MEET A KINDNESS LIKE THIS SEEMED TO UNNERVE HIM
A WAVE OF ANNOYANCE SWEPT OVER MARY AMBER'S FACE
NOBODY'LL BE ANY THE WISER AND I'LL TAKE A LOT MORE COMFORT
HE HADN'T HAD SUCH CARE SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE FELLOW IN THE HOSPITAL AT PREP SCHOOL
AND SHE LUXURIATED IN THE SERVICE
AND SHE HAD A GUILTY SENSE OF HIDING THE TRUTH FROM HER DEAR YOUNG FRIEND THAT MADE HER BREATHE MORE FREELY AS SHE WATCHED MARY AMBER'S FLIGHT
ALL HIS PERFIDY IN GETTING SICK ON A STRANGE GENTLEWOMAN'S HANDS AND LYING LAZILY IN BED
WAS SHOWN UP IN MARY AMBER'S VOICE
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WOULD COME MARY AMBER'S KEEN ACCUSING VOICE
SHE HOPED MARY AMBER'S MOTHER WOULD NOT COME TO THE DOOR AND ASK QUESTIONS
MARY AMBER'S TONE STATED THAT SHE HERSELF WAS NOT IN THE LEAST WORKED UP ABOUT A GREAT
SAID MARY AMBER COMMANDINGLY
A LITTLE CURVE OF SATISFACTION SETTLED ABOUT MARY AMBER'S MOUTH
AND CAPABLY PUT IT BEFORE HIM
SERGEANT GAGE IS A MEMBER OF THE SAME DIVISION AND CAME OVER IN THE SAME SHIP WITH MISS CHADWICK'S NEPHEW
AND MATTHEW HENSON
TO HUNT THE RACCOON AND OPOSSUM WHICH
THE CITY WHICH STANDS ON THE PLACE OF ONE OF THESE FRIENDLY POWWOWS IS CALLED COUNCIL BLUFFS
NOW SO COMMON IN STOCKBROKERS' OFFICES
THE PERSON THUS QUERYING SO DESPAIRINGLY WITH HIMSELF WAS A MAN NOT FAR FROM THIRTY YEARS OF AGE
AS HE GAZED ADORINGLY
THEY OUTGROW THE IDEA THAT TO BE FAST AND FOOLISH IS TO BE MEN AS NATURALLY AS THEY DO THEIR ROUNDABOUTS
MISTER HUNTING INTIMATED THAT AFTER ONE REACHED THE CHARMED INNER CIRCLE WALL STREET WAS A PERFECT ELDORADO
WE MUST PLACE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN MISTER HUNTING'S WORD IN THIS MATTER
BUT WHEN HE PROVED TO THEM THAT HE HAD LOST HIS PRIVATE MEANS BY HUNTING'S TREACHERY
AND WAS ATTENDED BY A RETINUE THAT WOULD HAVE REJOICED AN EPICURE'S HEART
AND TOAST WERE SMOKING APPETIZINGLY BESIDE HIM
BUT THE PURPOSE TO RETURN EVER DWELT PLEASURABLY IN HIS MIND
IF I CONTINUE TO FAIL IN HEALTH AS I HAVE OF LATE I SHALL KNOW CURSEDLY SOON
HOW EVERYTHING CONSPIRES TO DAY TO BRING MY HOME LIFE BACK AGAIN
THOUGH QUIET REFINEMENT AND PECULIAR UNOBTRUSIVENESS SEEMED HER CHARACTERISTICS
EVEN AS A FINGER POINTED AT A FESTERING WOUND CAUSES ANTICIPATORY AGONIES
HOW HACKNEYED AND BLASE HE HAD BECOME
IF I WERE A JUDGE UPON THE BENCH I SHOULD CHARGE THAT YOU WERE EVADING THE QUESTION AND BEFOGGING THE CASE
IN HER DELICATE REFERENCE TO HIS PARENTS' FAITH SHE HAD SUGGESTED AN ARGUMENT FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER
DIVERTS MY MIND
BUT PERHAPS IT IS TUPPER YOU WOULD LIKE
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THE QUESTION OF WHAT WAS AGREEABLE OR OTHERWISE SCARCELY ENTERED INTO A PURITAN'S MOTIVES
IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO TAKE AN OBSTINATE HERETIC'S HEAD OFF THAN TO ARGUE WITH HIM
I THINK IT WAS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PERSECUTOR'S METHOD THAT KEPT IT IN FAVOR SO LONG
I DOUBT WHETHER ANY ONE COULD UNHORSE YOU SHE REPLIED IN A LOW TONE
OR A PURSUIT THAT PROMISES GOOD TO HIMSELF AND TO OTHERS AND THAT ENLISTS HIS INTEREST
A VERITABLE HEBE
IT PORTRAYS OUR PAST
SHE HAD LEANED UPON CHARLES HUNTING'S ARM
MOST FOLKS RILE ME
THEY HAVE NO WATERPROOFS OR WOOD FIRES
THE LANGUID HALF HEARTEDNESS OF THE CHURCH DISCOURAGES ME MORE THAN ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD
I FEAR THAT I AM TO YOU THE EMBODIMENT OF THE DEPLETIVE SYSTEM
THE MIND ITSELF IS OPPRESSED BY THE EXTENSIVENESS OF THE SCENE
AND WERE ALL UNBURDENED WITH THOUGHT OR CARE FOR THE INDEFINITE REGIONS THAT STRETCHED AWAY BEYOND THEIR NARROW CIRCLE OF DAILY ACQUAINTANCE
WERE PLEASANT OBJECTS TO THE MOUNTAIN RAMBLERS
BUT THE COUNTERFEITER AT FIRST GAVE ALL HIS ATTENTION TO HER COMPANION
STILL CLINGING TO A HAND UNSANCTIFIED BY THE SIGNIFICANT PLAIN RING
FOR A DESPERATE AND SUCCESSFUL COUNTERFEITER DWELT FOR A TIME AMONG THE MOUNTAINS ON THE HUDSON
HIS BROODINGS HAD BEEN SO DEEP AND PAINFUL DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE NIGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN OBLIVIOUS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS
SHE BEWITCHES AND SWAYS ME BY HER SPELLS
YOUNG TOMPKINS BROUGHT THEM WITH THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE DEPOT
WITH MUCH BEFOGGING OF THE CASE
I CONSIDER SUCH PEOPLE THE GREATEST DEMORALIZERS OF THE AGE
HER LEAVING THE WALTONS AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF SERVICE AND KINDNESS
STILL SHE MADE PROPITIATING OVERTURES IN THE BROWNEST OF BUTTERED TOAST
SHE COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY OF THE REMARKABLE EFFECTS OF THE TRAINED VOCALIST
AND NOW LOOK CLOSELY AND JUSTLY AT YOUR THEME'S CONNECTION
DO NOT FOR A MOMENT THINK THAT I CAN LOOK WITH ANY LENIENCE OR INDULGENCE ON ALL THE HORRIBLE EVIL YOU HAVE LAID BEFORE ME
AND WITH A GLEAM OF HER OLD MIRTHFULNESS SHE CONTINUED
GREGORY WAS ABOUT TO REPLY INDISCREETLY
OTHERWISE SHE ONLY OVERRUNS THE HEART SHE MIGHT HAVE RULED
A LITTLE WONDERINGLY AT HUNTING'S MANNER
SHE HAD A GROWING DISSATISFACTION WITH HUNTING'S MANNER IN REGARD TO GREGORY
MEN ARE SO STRANGE SHE SAID HALF VEXEDLY
HUNTING'S FACE DARKENED WITH SUPPRESSED ANGER AND JEALOUSY
AND HIS FACE DARKENED FORBIDDINGLY
BUT TO MAKE A SMILING MEMBER OF CHARLES HUNTING'S FRIENDLY CIRCLE WOULD REQUIRE ON MY PART THE BALDEST HYPOCRISY
FOR HIS STRONG FAITH COMMITTED THEM TRUSTINGLY TO GOD
TO THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE CUSSED YOU WHEN IT WAS THE GOOD LORD THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE DO YOU THINK SO ASKED GREGORY
AFTER I'D SMOKED A GOOD MANY PIPES I CUSSED MYSELF FOR AN OLD FOOL
THESE WALTONS ARE ALL BOUND TO BE THERE
BUT IT HAD PAINED HER DEEPLY THAT HE HAD NOT MET HUNTING'S ADVANCES
THAT MISTER HUNTING'S MANNER AND FEELINGS TOWARD ME WERE SINCERELY CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY
AS SHE RECOVERED STRENGTH OF BODY AND MIND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT SHE MUST TRUSTINGLY PUT IN GOD'S HANDS AND LEAVE THERE
WHILE COLOR CAME INTO EVEN HUNTING'S PALE FACE
UNKNOWING AND UNCARING
WHAT IS HUNTING'S NUMBER FORTY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
HUNTING'S DOOR WAS JAMMED AND HAD TO BE BROKEN OPEN
FOR HUNTING'S HANDS SO TREMBLED THAT HE WAS HELPLESS
THEY STOOD WAITING WHERE THE LANTERN'S GLARE FELL UPON THEIR FACES
FOR HE WAS DEEPLY DISGUSTED AT HUNTING'S BEHAVIOR
HOW SOON I MAY SEE FATHER AND MOTHER SHE STOOD NOW WITH ONE HAND ON HUNTING'S TREMBLING ARM
HUNTING'S WILD CRY MINGLED WITH THE DESPAIRING SHRIEK OF MANY OTHERS
EVEN IF HUNTING'S DISHONESTY HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
